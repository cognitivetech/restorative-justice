> As developed in the favelas of Brazil in the mid 1990s, where it later became known as Círculos Restaurativos, it brings together the three parties to a conflict - those who have acted, those directly impacted and the wider community - within a chosen systemic context, to dialogue as equals. Participants invite each other and attend voluntarily. The dialogue process used is shared openly with all participants. The process ends when actions have been found that bring mutual benefit that nurtures the inherent integrity of all those involved in the conflict.

> Círculos Restaurativos are facilitated by community members who identify themselves as impacted by the conflict at hand. They commit to serving the emergent wisdom of the participants through their willingness to offer questions sourced from an agreed upon basis and to track the co-creation of meaning and intra-personal, inter-personal and social action by those present.

#### [Kenny Johnson Author of The Last Hustle and Founder, This Sacred Space](https://restorativejusticeontherise.org/kenny-johnson-author-of-the-last-hustle-and-founder-this-sacred-space/)  - MAR 22, 2012

> [Kenny Johnson](https://www.kennydjohnson.com/) devoted his life to crime, beginning in his early teens and served over twenty years in various city, county, state, and federal prisons. During his early years in prison, he spent most of his time participating in all sorts of religious and substance abuse groups. Hopefully, in one of these groups he would hear the magic words that would release him from the grip of his inner and outer prisons. It was his inner desire for freedom that led him and a band of truth-seekers to a meeting in the prison chapel. Antoinette Varner, his spiritual teacher answered his most pressing question.
> 
> Kenny Johnson is the author of the book “[The Last Hustle](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Hustle-True-Story/dp/1606452177), ” chronicling his years as a criminal and how he was transformed while incarcerated. His story proves that however hard and unpromising our particular life circumstances, we can discover true happiness.
> 
> He speaks of this freedom at correctional facilities the world over. His story is an inspiration to hundreds of others. For thirty-one years Kenny Johnson’s most fervent desire was to hear his name ‘ringing in the streets’ as a hustler, thief, and pimp. Running parallel with that desire was a persistent seed of spiritual longing that would not leave him alone. Kenny was arrested thirty-seven times and spent much of his life in prison, or on the run. Each time behind bars sent him into a deep and profound despair. Eventually his desire for lasting freedom would drive him to find a power that could not only get him through his final sentence, but free him from prison forever. “I had to find a power that would not only get me through my current sentence, but would free me from prison forever.”

We believe this process has much to offer other post-conflict countries-and the world.

> Fred Van Liew, a lawyer, mediator, consultant, trainer, lobbyist, community organizer, and novice blogger, is the Director for the Center for Restorative Justice Practices in Des Moines, Iowa. For most of his twenty-eight years as a practicing attorney he worked as a prosecutor "inside the system." He learned much during those years but looking back says what he took away from the experience is that we can do much better when it comes to how we respond to crime and those who commit them.  Fred retired as a prosecutor in 2010 and worked for awhile applying Restorative Justice principles to workplace conflicts. He takes part-time classes in [Conflict Transformation at Eastern Mennonite University](https://emu.edu/cjp/grad/conflict-transformation) and says he is fortunate to have Howard Zehr as his mentor.

Given there are many views and opinions of what this hugely growing field entails, and how it works, we are delighted to speak with not only someone who has lived the processes first hand but who can truly help clarify the things that commonly cause people to question the efficacy of Restorative Justice, and to show how common concerns of accountability, safety, and respect for victims still plays a huge role in guiding the processes.

They are leveraging programs that combine youth empowerment with job skills in Green jobs and food production to reduce juvenile incarceration and recidivism successfully. Their approach not only saves thousands of dollars in the diversion of youth from sentencing and incarceration, but also gives them an opportunity to exemplify accountability and repayment of their offenses by putting their hands in the soil, literally. It's exciting to see the inclusion and connection of Green programs with Restorative Justice and I'm really excited to hear all about how the program got started, how it works, and how others can replicate it. Many agree that youth should not have a track record that tracks them endlessly and stigmatizes their chances to gain employment and establish successful lives that illuminate their own unique gift to the world. This is one big way to make that difference without losing the important values of accountability, restitution, and community safety.

> In 2016 Eric Luecking was the first to hear the unthinkable. His brother, Matt (pictured to the right, at left; Eric at right), was dead, murdered. The big brother that lived as an inspiration to so many was gone, just like that. Since that life-altering day in October 2016 Eric has worked to further the possibility of VOD & restorative justice program implementation and is a national speaker advocating for restorative justice as a surviving family member and brother to Matt whose life was cut way too short.

> Matt was an inspiration for the many lives he touched while living. After he passed in 2016, his friends and colleagues continued to spread his “[Blessed For Another Day](https://blessedforanotherday.com/)” messages through social media. In his honor, Eric created this website to focus on positivity.
>

Since his brother's murder in 2016, he has been on a journey of self-reflection and finding his place again in the world, constantly looking at new ways to approach the hardships that life can bring. By openly sharing his story, he has found a way to re-channel his love for Matt to positively influence friends, family, and anyone else who will listen. Through speaking events at churches, universities, and podcasts, he tells a powerful story about how forgiveness has given him the freedom to move forward and cut any ties that would bind him to self-defeat.
>

> Description of both dialogues: Dominic Barter shares poignantly in both interviews first by the tone of his sharing and presence, which in fact illuminates the equanimity that is felt in the actual process he helps guide with his work in Restorative Circles. The first conversation in 2012 offers insights into his own journey and reasons for contributing to our world in this way, and specifics as to what the process entails. In the second conversation from Summer 2013 Dom is joined by his colleague Sissi Mazzetti, whom together have worked tirelessly to hear and support systems within Brazil’s education system. Both practical as well as conveying the actual climate of a circle process, these conversations are both of great value to those working in their own communities, schools, and lives to further both the way of living that this lens illuminates as well as the systems integration.

#### [Charles Eisenstein](https://restorativejusticeontherise.org/charles-eisenstein/) - MAY 26, 2015

> In a time of social and ecological crisis, what can we as individuals do to make the world a better place? This inspirational and thought-provoking book serves as an empowering antidote to the cynicism, frustration, paralysis, and overwhelm so many of us are feeling, replacing it with a grounding reminder of what’s true: we are all connected, and our small, personal choices bear unsuspected transformational power. By fully embracing and practicing this principle of interconnectedness—called interbeing—we become more effective agents of change and have a stronger positive influence on the world.
>
> Throughout the book, Eisenstein relates real-life stories showing how small, individual acts of courage, kindness, and self-trust can change our culture’s guiding narrative of separation, which, he shows, has generated the present planetary crisis. He brings to conscious awareness a deep wisdom we all innately know: until we get our selves in order, any action we take—no matter how good our intentions—will ultimately be wrongheaded and wronghearted. Above all, Eisenstein invites us to embrace a radically different understanding of cause and effect, sounding a clarion call to surrender our old worldview of separation, so that we can finally create the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.

#### [Michael Nagler of the Metta Center for Nonviolence](https://restorativejusticeontherise.org/michael-nagler-of-the-metta-center-for-nonviolence/) - NOV 19, 2018

> Probably the most hopeful sign in today’s world is the way nonviolence and the knowledge of how it works is spreading. The knowledge, however, often lags behind the practice. Our culture is simply not “tuned in” to a power that draws upon the unity of life instead of the competitiveness and alienation that are the prevailing image of humanity and its lack of meaning. Here a little knowledge can be a safe thing, for with it people who find themselves caught up in a potentially nonviolent struggle—as they are right now all over the Middle East as well as in far less heralded movements in places like Honduras and Mexico—can act both more safely and more effectively. This effect is far from limited, as is sometimes thought, to insurrectionary struggles. Gandhi experimented with principled nonviolence in literally every walk of life from health care to national defense, so it is possible for every one of us to engage this great power not just against unwanted regimes but as a way of changing cultures so that such regimes could be denied a grip on societies (provided we understand well enough what are the basic principles and how to apply which ones). This is where we at Metta come in. As a friend of ours said recently, we are a “small but mighty” group of people with a burning passion to develop for ourselves and others an ever deeper understanding of the potential and power of nonviolence. We work with students, educators, activists, the media and military personnel from around the world who see, however far off in the future, a vision of healing, respect, justice and compassion based on a much higher image of the human being and the meaning of life. We welcome the opportunity to work with you in building a more nonviolent world. In peace, Michael Nagler, Founder and President, [Metta Center for Nonviolence](http://www.mettacenter.org)

> [Debby Irving](https://debbyirving.com/) is a racial justice educator, author, and public speaker. A community organizer and classroom teacher for 25 years, Debby Irving grappled with racial injustice without understanding racism as a systemic issue or her own whiteness as an obstacle to it.

> [Waking Up White](https://debbyirving.com/the-book/) is the book Debby Irving wishes someone had handed her decades ago. By sharing her sometimes cringe-worthy struggle to understand racism and racial tensions, she offers a fresh perspective on bias, stereotypes, manners, and tolerance. As she unpacks her own long-held beliefs about colorblindness, being a good person, and wanting to help people of color, she reveals how each of these well-intentioned mindsets actually perpetuated her ill-conceived ideas about race. She also explains why and how she’s changed the way she talks about racism, works in racially mixed groups, and understands the racial justice movement as a whole. Exercises at the end of each chapter prompt readers to explore their own racialized ideas. Waking Up White's personal narrative is designed to work well as a rapid read, a book group book, or support reading for courses exploring racial and cultural issues.

His steps for healing our philanthropy include a proper recognition of the problems, which are critical, and a turning back to what might be termed Indigenous perspectives and practices around giving--seeing our work and lives as interconnected and providing equal voices to communities most in need and impacted by sub par funding and services.  We talk about the importance of the Native peoples view of life as "7 back, 7 forward"--meaning, living and giving in a way that recalls our ancestors and thinks about the world our children and their children will inherit.This is a rich discussion which reveals viable steps and solutions to local and global philanthropy.
