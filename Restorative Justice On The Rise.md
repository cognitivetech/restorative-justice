  > Mali Rowan Presents Restorative Justice & Social Healing in the US and Beyond Dialogue Series with very special guest James O'Dea
  > 
  > I began working with James O'Dea in 2004 when he was President at the Institute of Noetic Sciences and with a core and common vision aimed at courageous Peacebuilding and deep interests in human rights, social healing and reform of prison systems in the US, I've enjoyed a continued collaboration with him. I find James to be, at essence, one of the best-kept secrets in Peacemaking and Peacebuilding in our world. His presence elicits a deep dive combining wisdom and practical insights. He is a humble servant of individual and collective transformation and has served at such organizations such as Amnesty International (as Director of Washington DC Office), [Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)](https://noetic.org/) as past President and Extended Faculty and the [SEVA Foundation](https://www.seva.org/site/SPageServer/).
  > 
  > James' life was almost snuffed out in a horrible attack overseas--a case of racial prejudice combined with mistaken identity. That event was a powerful impetus for him to dive into the world of Amnesty and do everything he could to stand for human rights. He once gave former President Clinton a scolding for his human rights record and has stood for the US to the United Nations surrounding International human rights issues. James now is focusing his time on teaching Peacebuilding and sharing his profound experiences, intellect, and insights with an international student body that include his INTIMATE Intensive offerings as well as the Peace Ambassador Training series with The Shift Network.
  > 
  > He is an author of a powerful paradigm-shifting book about stress, [Creative Stress: A Path for Evolving Souls Living through Personal and Planetary Upheaval](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7961815-creative-stress), and is penning a soon-to-be-published book, Cultivating Peace, due out early 2012.

  > As developed in the favelas of Brazil in the mid 1990s, where it later became known as Círculos Restaurativos, it brings together the three parties to a conflict - those who have acted, those directly impacted and the wider community - within a chosen systemic context, to dialogue as equals. Participants invite each other and attend voluntarily. The dialogue process used is shared openly with all participants. The process ends when actions have been found that bring mutual benefit that nurtures the inherent integrity of all those involved in the conflict.
  > 
  > Círculos Restaurativos are facilitated in 3 stages that arise in an approximate sequence and identity the key factors in the conflict, reach agreements on next steps, and evaluate the results. As a circle form, they invite shared power, mutual understanding and self-responsibility within community.
  > 
  > Círculos Restaurativos are facilitated by community members who identify themselves as impacted by the conflict at hand. They commit to serving the emergent wisdom of the participants through their willingness to offer questions sourced from an agreed upon basis and to track the co-creation of meaning and intra-personal, inter-personal and social action by those present.

  > 
  > Kenny Johnson devoted his life to crime, beginning in his early teens and served over twenty years in various city, county, state, and federal prisons. During his early years in prison, he spent most of his time participating in all sorts of religious and substance abuse groups. Hopefully, in one of these groups he would hear the magic words that would release him from the grip of his inner and outer prisons. It was his inner desire for freedom that led him and a band of truth-seekers to a meeting in the prison chapel. Antoinette Varner, his spiritual teacher answered his most pressing question.
  > 
  > Kenny Johnson is the author of the book “The Last Hustle” chronicling his years as a criminal and how he was transformed while incarcerated. His story proves that however hard and unpromising our particular life circumstances, we can discover true happiness.
  > 
  > He speaks of this freedom at correctional facilities the world over. His story is an inspiration to hundreds of others. For thirty-one years Kenny Johnson’s most fervent desire was to hear his name ‘ringing in the streets’ as a hustler, thief, and pimp. Running parallel with that desire was a persistent seed of spiritual longing that would not leave him alone. Kenny was arrested thirty-seven times and spent much of his life in prison, or on the run. Each time behind bars sent him into a deep and profound despair. Eventually his desire for lasting freedom would drive him to find a power that could not only get him through his final sentence, but free him from prison forever. “I had to find a power that would not only get me through my current sentence, but would free me from prison forever.”

A former Political Science professor at Principia College, Ms. Hoffman left academia to focus on the practice of conflict resolution and peacebuilding. She has developed and led conflict resolution training programs in corporate, congregational, educational and community settings.
  > 
  > She was a founder and Executive Director of Peace Discovery Initiatives, which pioneered in positive approaches to peacebuilding, as well as in mobilizing religious resources for peace. She has designed, convened and facilitated backchannel Middle East peacemaking initiatives and worked to bring grassroots Israeli and Palestinian peacemakers together with American policymakers. She advocated for religion to be used as a constructive element of this peacemaking process and pioneered in techniques for doing this, culminating in the establishment of the Center for World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University. [Fambul Tok International](https://fambultok.org/)) is dedicated to advancing peace by mobilizing ordinary people-entire communities ravaged by war-in the hard work of reconciliation. Fambul Tok originated in the realization that peace can't be imposed from the outside, or the top down. Nor does it need to be. The community led and owned peacebuilding we support, witness and celebrate in Sierra Leone are teaching us that communities have within them the resources they need for their own healing. We believe this process has much to offer other post-conflict countries-and the world.

> A [Restorative Circle](https://restorativerevolution.com/restorative-circles-resources/) is a community process for supporting those in conflict. It brings together the three parties to a conflict – those who have acted, those directly impacted and the wider community – within an intentional systemic context, to dialogue as equals. Participants invite each other and attend voluntarily. The dialogue process used is shared openly with all participants, and guided by a community member. The process ends when actions have been found that bring mutual benefit. ~Dominic Barter
