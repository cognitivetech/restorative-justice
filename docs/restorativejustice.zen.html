<p>Marshaled against a virus that has sickened at least 2.6 million in the U.S., killed more than 126,000 people and cost tens of millions of jobs and $3 trillion in federal rescue money, state and local government health workers on the ground are sometimes paid so little that they qualify for public aid.</p>
<p>They track the coronavirus on paper records shared via fax. Working seven-day weeks for months on end, they fear pay freezes, public backlash and even losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Since 2010, spending for state public health departments has dropped by 16% per capita and spending for <a href="http://nacchoprofilestudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2019-Profile-Preparedness-Capacity.pdf">local health departments</a> has fallen by 18%, according to a <em>KHN</em> and <em>Associated Press</em> analysis of government spending on public health. At least 38,000 state and local public health jobs have disappeared since the 2008 recession, leaving a skeletal workforce for what was once viewed as one of the world’s top public health systems.</p>
<p><em>KHN</em> and <em>AP</em> interviewed more than 150 public health workers, policymakers and experts, analyzed spending records from hundreds of state and local health departments, and surveyed statehouses. On every level, the investigation found, the system is underfunded and under threat, unable to protect the nation’s health.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in April that his “biggest regret” was “that our nation failed over decades to effectively invest in public health.”</p>
<p>So when this outbreak arrived — and when, according to public health experts, the federal government bungled its response — hollowed-out state and local health departments were ill-equipped to step into the breach.</p>
<p>Over time, their work had received so little support that they found themselves without direction, <a href="https://khn.org/news/public-health-officials-face-wave-of-threats-pressure-amid-coronavirus-response/">disrespected, ignored, even vilified</a>. The desperate struggle against COVID-19 became increasingly politicized and grew more difficult.</p>
<p>States, cities and counties in dire straits have begun laying off and furloughing members of already limited staffs, and even more devastation looms, as states reopen and cases surge. Historically, even when money pours in following crises such as Zika and H1N1, it disappears after the emergency subsides. Officials fear the same thing is happening now.</p>
<p>“We don’t say to the fire department, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. There were no fires last year, so we’re going to take 30% of your budget away.’ That would be crazy, right?” said Dr. Gianfranco Pezzino, the health officer in Shawnee County, Kansas. “But we do that with public health, day in and day out.”</p>
<p>Ohio’s Toledo-Lucas County Health Department spent $17 million, or $40 per person, in 2017.</p>
<p>Jennifer Gottschalk, 42, works for the county as an environmental health supervisor. When the coronavirus struck, the county’s department was so short-staffed that her duties included overseeing campground and pool inspections, rodent control and sewage programs, while also supervising outbreak preparedness for a community of more than 425,000 people.</p>
<p>When Gottschalk and five colleagues fell ill with COVID-19, she found herself fielding calls about a COVID-19 case from her hospital bed, then working through her home isolation. She stopped only when her coughing was too severe to talk on calls.</p>
<p>“You have to do what you have to do to get the job done,” Gottschalk said.</p>
<p>Now, after months of working with hardly a day off, she said the job is wearing on her. So many lab reports on coronavirus cases came in, the office fax machine broke. She faces a backlash from the community over coronavirus restrictions and there are countless angry phone calls.</p>
<p>Things could get worse; possible county budget cuts loom.</p>
<p>But Toledo-Lucas is no outlier. Public health ranks low on the nation’s financial priority list. Nearly two-thirds of Americans live in counties that spend more than twice as much on policing as they spend on non-hospital health care, which includes public health.</p>
<p>More than three-quarters of Americans live in states that spend less than $100 per person annually on public health. Spending ranges from $32 in Louisiana to $263 in Delaware, according to data provided to KHN and AP by the <a href="http://systemsforaction.org/projects/optimizing-governmental-health-and-social-spending-interactions/tools/state-health-expenditure-dataset-shed-2000-2013">State Health Expenditure Dataset</a> project.</p>
<p>That money represents less than 1.5% of most states’ total spending, with half of it passed down to local health departments.</p>
<p>The share of spending devoted to public health belies its multidimensional role. Agencies are legally bound to provide a broad range of services, from vaccinations and restaurant inspections to protection against infectious disease. Distinct from the medical care system geared toward individuals, the public health system focuses on the health of communities at large.</p>
<p>“Public health loves to say: When we do our job, nothing happens. But that’s not really a great badge,” said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “We test 97% of America’s babies for metabolic or other disorders. We do the water testing. You like to swim in the lake and you don’t like poop in there? Think of us.”</p>
<p>But the public doesn’t see the disasters they thwart. And it’s easy to neglect the invisible.</p>
<h2>A History of Deprivation</h2>
<p>The local health department was a well-known place in the 1950s and 1960s, when Harris Pastides, president emeritus of the University of South Carolina, was growing up in New York City.</p>
<p>“My mom took me for my vaccines. We would get our injections there for free. We would get our polio sugar cubes there for free,” said Pastides, an epidemiologist. “In those days, the health departments had a highly visible role in disease prevention.”</p>
<p>The United States’ decentralized public health system, which matches federal funding and expertise with local funding, knowledge and delivery, was long the envy of the world, said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.</p>
<p>“A lot of what we’re seeing right now could be traced back to the chronic funding shortages,” Omer said. “The way we starve our public health system, the way we have tried to do public health outcomes on the cheap in this country.”</p>
<p>In Scott County, Indiana, when preparedness coordinator Patti Hall began working at the health department 34 years ago, it ran a children’s clinic and a home health agency with several nurses and aides. But over time, the children’s clinic lost funding and closed. Medicare changes paved the way for private services to replace the home health agency. Department staff dwindled in the 1990s and early 2000s. The county was severely outgunned when rampant opioid use and needle sharing <a href="https://khn.org/news/five-years-later-hiv-hit-town-rebounds-but-the-nation-is-slow-to-heed-lessons/">sparked an outbreak</a> of HIV in 2015.</p>
<p>Besides just five full-time and one part-time county public health positions, there was only one doctor in the outbreak’s epicenter of Austin. Indiana’s then-Gov. Mike Pence, now leading the nation’s coronavirus response as vice president, waited 29 days after the outbreak was announced to sign an executive order allowing syringe exchanges. At the time, a state official said that only five people from agencies across Indiana were available to help with HIV testing in the county.</p>
<p>The HIV outbreak exploded into the worst ever to hit rural America, infecting more than 230 people.</p>
<p>At times, the federal government has promised to support local public health efforts, to help prevent similar calamities. But those promises were ephemeral.</p>
<p>Two large sources of money established after Sept. 11, 2001 — the Public Health Emergency Preparedness program and the Hospital Preparedness Program — were gradually chipped away.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act established the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which was supposed to reach $2 billion annually by 2015. The Obama administration and Congress raided it to pay for other priorities, including a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/04/republicans-jam-harkin-on-preventive-health-fund-075684">payroll tax cut</a>. The Trump administration is pushing to repeal the ACA, which would eliminate the fund, said Carolyn Mullen, senior vice president of government affairs and public relations at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.</p>
<p>Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat who championed the fund, said he was furious when the Obama White House took billions from it, breaking what he said was an agreement.</p>
<p>“I haven’t spoken to Barack Obama since,” Harkin said.</p>
<p>If the fund had remained untouched, an additional $12.4 billion would eventually have flowed to local and state health departments.</p>
<p>But local and state leaders also did not prioritize public health over the years.</p>
<p>In Florida, for example, 2% of state spending goes to public health. Spending by local health departments in the state fell 39%, from a high of $57 in inflation-adjusted dollars per person in the late 1990s to $35 per person last year.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, Wake County’s public health workforce dropped from 882 in 2007 to 614 a decade later, even as the population grew by 30%.</p>
<p>In Detroit, the health department had 700 employees in 2009, then was effectively disbanded during the city’s bankruptcy proceedings. It’s been built back up, but today still has only 200 workers for 670,000 residents.</p>
<p>Many departments rely heavily on disease-specific grant funding, creating unstable and temporary positions. The CDC’s core budget, some of which goes to state and local health departments, has essentially remained flat for a decade. Federal money currently accounts for 27% of local public health spending.</p>
<p>Years of such financial pressure increasingly pushed workers in this predominantly female workforce toward retirement or the private sector and kept potential new hires away.</p>
<p>More than a fifth of public health workers in local or regional departments outside big cities earned $35,000 or less a year in 2017, as did 9% in big-city departments, according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6519878/">research</a> by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and the de Beaumont Foundation.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, <a href="https://www.debeaumont.org/phwins-findings/">nearly half</a> of public health workers planned to retire or leave their organizations for other reasons in the next five years. Poor pay topped the list of reasons.</p>
<p>Armed with a freshly minted bachelor’s degree, Julia Crittendon took a job two years ago as a disease intervention specialist with Kentucky’s state health department. She spent her days gathering detailed information about people’s sexual partners to fight the spread of HIV and syphilis. She tracked down phone numbers and drove hours to pick up reluctant clients.</p>
<p>The mother of three loved the work but made so little money that she qualified for Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for America’s poorest. Seeing no opportunity to advance, she left.</p>
<p>“We’re like the redheaded stepchildren, the forgotten ones,” said Crittendon, 46.</p>
<p>Such low pay is endemic, with some employees qualifying for the nutrition program for new moms and babies that they administer. People with the training for many public health jobs, which can include a bachelor’s or master’s degree, can make much more money in the private health care sector, robbing the public departments of promising recruits.</p>
<p>Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director, said the agency “intentionally underpaid people” in a training program that sent early-career professionals to state and local public health departments to build the workforce.</p>
<p>“If we paid them at the very lowest level at the federal scale,” he said in an interview, “they would have to take a 10-20% pay cut to continue on at the local health department.”</p>
<p>As low pay sapped the workforce, budget cuts sapped services.</p>
<p>In Alaska, the Division of Public Health’s spending dropped 9% from 2014 to 2018 and staffing fell by 82 positions in a decade to 426. Tim Struna, chief of public health nursing in Alaska, said declines in oil prices in the mid-2010s led the state to make cuts to public health nursing services. They eliminated well-child exams for children over 6, scaled back searches for the partners of people with certain sexually transmitted infections and limited reproductive health services to people 29 and younger.</p>
<p>Living through an endless stream of such cuts and their aftermath, those workers on the ground grew increasingly worried about mustering the “surge capacity” to expand beyond their daily responsibilities to handle inevitable emergencies.</p>
<p>When the fiercest of enemies showed up in the U.S. this year, the depleted public health army struggled to hold it back.</p>
<h2>A Decimated Surge Capacity</h2>
<p>As the public health director for the Kentucky River District Health Department in rural Appalachia, Scott Lockard is battling the pandemic with 3G cell service, paper records and one-third of the employees the department had 20 years ago.</p>
<p>He redeployed his nurse administrator to work round-the-clock on contact tracing, alongside the department’s school nurse and the tuberculosis and breastfeeding coordinator. His home health nurse, who typically visits older patients, now works on preparedness plans. But residents aren’t making it easy on them.</p>
<p>“They’re not wearing masks, and they’re throwing social distancing to the wind,” Lockard said in mid-June, as cases surged. “We’re paying for it.”</p>
<p>Even with more staff since the HIV outbreak, Indiana’s Scott County Health Department employees worked evenings, weekends and holidays to deal with the pandemic, including outbreaks at a food packing company and a label manufacturer. Indiana spends $37 a person on public health.</p>
<p>“When you get home, the phone never stops, the emails and texts never stop,” said Hall, the preparedness coordinator.</p>
<p>All the while, she and her colleagues worry about keeping HIV under control and preventing drug overdoses from rising. Other health problems don’t just disappear because there is a pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’ve been used to being able to ‘MacGyver’ everything on a normal day, and this is not a normal day,” said Amanda Mehl, the public health administrator for Boone County, Illinois, citing a TV show.</p>
<p>Pezzino, whose department in Kansas serves Topeka and Shawnee County, said he had been trying to hire an epidemiologist, who would study, track and analyze data on health issues, since he came to the department 14 years ago. Finally, less than three years ago, they hired one. She just left, and he thinks it will be nearly impossible to find another.</p>
<p>While epidemiologists are nearly universal in departments serving large populations, hardly any departments serving smaller populations have one. Only 28% of local health departments have an epidemiologist or statistician.</p>
<p>Strapped departments are now forced to spend money on contact tracers, masks and gloves to keep their workers safe and to do basic outreach.</p>
<p>Melanie Hutton, administrator for the Cooper County Public Health Center in rural Missouri, pointed out the local ambulance department got $18,000, and the fire and police departments got masks to fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>“For us, not a nickel, not a face mask,” she said. “We got [5] gallons of homemade hand sanitizer made by the prisoners.”</p>
<p>Public health workers are leaving in droves. At least 34 state and local public health leaders have announced their resignations, retired or been fired in 17 states since April, a <em>KHN-AP</em> review found. Others face threats and armed demonstrators.</p>
<p>Ohio’s Gottschalk said the backlash has been overwhelming.</p>
<p>“Being yelled at by residents for almost two hours straight last week on regulations I cannot control left me feeling completely burned out,” she said in mid-June.</p>
<p>Many are putting their health at risk. In Prince George’s County, Maryland, public health worker Chantee Mack died after, family and co-workers believe, she and several colleagues contracted the disease in the office.</p>
<h2>A Difficult Road Ahead</h2>
<p>Pence, in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/there-isnt-a-coronavirus-second-wave-11592327890">op-ed</a> in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on June 16, said the public health system was “far stronger” than it was when the coronavirus hit.</p>
<p>It’s true that the federal government this year has allocated billions for public health in response to the pandemic, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. That includes more than $13 billion to state and local health departments, for activities including contact tracing, infection control and technology upgrades.</p>
<p>A KHN-AP review found that some state and local governments are also pledging more money for public health. Alabama’s budget for next year, for example, includes $35 million more for public health than it did this year.</p>
<p>But overall, spending is about to be slashed again as the boom-bust cycle continues.</p>
<p>In most states, the new budget year begins July 1, and furloughs, layoffs and pay freezes have already begun in some places. Tax revenues evaporated during lockdowns, all but ensuring there will be more. At least 14 states have already cut health department budgets or positions or were actively considering such cuts in June, according to a <em>KHN-AP</em> review.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic began, Michigan temporarily cut most of its state health workers’ hours by one-fifth. Pennsylvania required more than 65 of its 1,200 public health workers to go on temporary leave, and others lost their jobs. Knox County, Tennessee, furloughed 26 out of 260 workers for eight weeks.</p>
<p>Frieden, formerly of the CDC, said it’s “stunning” that the U.S. is furloughing public health workers amid a pandemic. The country should demand the resources for public health, he said, just the way it does for the military.</p>
<p>“This is about protecting Americans,” Frieden said.</p>
<p>Cincinnati temporarily furloughed approximately 170 health department employees.</p>
<p>Robert Brown, chair of Cincinnati’s Primary Care Board, questions why police officers and firefighters didn’t face <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/coronavirus-cincinnati-details-city-furloughs-impact/5094603002/">similar furloughs</a> at the time or why residents were willing to pay hundreds of <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/insider/county-has-spent-920m-in-deal-to-build-stadium-keep-nfl-team-in-town-since-2000">millions in taxes</a> over decades for the Bengals’ football stadium.</p>
<p>“How about investing in something that’s going to save some lives?” he asked.</p>
<p>In 2018, Boston spent five times as much on its police department as its public health department. The city <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2020/06/boston-mayor-marty-walsh-declares-racism-a-public-health-crisis-diverts-police-overtime-money-to-community-programs.html">recently pledged</a> to transfer $3 million from its approximately $60 million police overtime budget to its public health commission.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, more cuts are coming. Possible budget shortfalls in Brazos County, Texas, may force the health department to limit its mosquito-surveillance program and eliminate up to one-fifth of its staff and one-quarter of immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Months into the pandemic response, health departments are still trying to ramp up to fight COVID-19. Cases are surging in states including Texas, Arizona and Florida.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, childhood vaccinations began plunging in the second half of March, according to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm?s_cid=mm6919e2_w">CDC study</a> analyzing supply orders. Officials worry whether they will be able to get kids back up to date in the coming months. In Detroit, the childhood vaccination rate dipped below 40%, as clinics shuttered and people stayed home, creating the potential for a different outbreak.</p>
<p>Cutting or eliminating non-COVID activities is dangerous, said E. Oscar Alleyne, chief of programs and services at the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Cuts to programs such as diabetes control and senior nutrition make already vulnerable communities even more vulnerable, which makes them more likely to suffer serious complications from COVID. Everything is connected, he said.</p>
<p>It could be a year before there’s a widely available vaccine. Meanwhile, other illnesses, including mental health problems, are smoldering.</p>
<p>The people who spend their lives working in public health say the temporary coronavirus funds won’t fix the eroded foundation entrusted with protecting the nation’s health as thousands continue to die.</p>

At the heart of the cases: Can House committees and a New York grand jury subpoena financial institutions for Trump’s personal and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-never-before-seen-trump-tax-documents-show-major-inconsistencies">business</a> tax filings?</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, it opens the possibility that the public could eventually see his personal tax return and business records, though <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/29/waiting-for-trumps-tax-returns-dont-hold-your-breath/">experts say</a> it would be unlikely to happen quickly. Here’s why people want to see Trump’s tax returns and what they may reveal about the president.</p>
<h2 data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2">Why Do Presidents Share Their Tax Returns in the First Place?</h2>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">Since Richard Nixon, presidents have shared their tax returns in some way or another with the public. Nixon perhaps <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/695054845/a-history-of-presidential-tax-returns">explained</a> why best: “I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president’s a crook. Well, I’m not a crook.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">But Nixon had not shared his tax returns entirely willingly. During the Watergate scandal, an IRS employee leaked information from Nixon’s tax returns that suggested that the president had underpaid his taxes for two years. As reporters put pressure on Nixon to disclose his returns, he finally shared them, confirming that he had wrongly claimed a deduction and woefully underpaid his taxes. Nixon, who was under audit at the time, was sent a tax bill of about $470,000 plus interest to pay in back taxes from the IRS.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">Nixon’s release of his federal returns set a precedent. While no law requires presidential candidates (or the president for that matter) to share his or her tax returns, it was understood among future candidates: The office of the presidency requires a certain amount of transparency, and voters have a right to know if their president pays his or her fair share of taxes and, yes, “whether or not their president’s a crook.”</p>
<h2 data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">Why Do People Want to See Trump’s Tax Returns?</h2>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">While Trump <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/17/news/donald-trump-tax-returns/index.html">promised</a> to share his tax returns during his 2016 campaign, he refused to do so when he assumed office, breaking this four-decade tradition among presidents and presidential candidates.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">Trump has <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/11/donald-trump/trump-wrong-reporters-are-only-ones-who-care-about/">claimed</a> that voters don’t care about his taxes. Polls suggest otherwise. According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/01/18/1-views-of-trump-2/">Pew Research poll</a>, 64% of Americans say that Trump has a responsibility to share his tax returns. His refusal to share them has some Americans wondering what he’s hiding.</p>

<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/702891487776866306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">So, Why Isn’t He Sharing Them Voluntarily?</h2>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Trump has offered many reasons for not sharing his tax returns. He has said that he couldn’t share them while he was under audit — but an audit wouldn’t prevent him from sharing them — and he has simply said that his <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-tax-rate-223156">tax rate</a> is “none of your business.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">Pundits have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-steve-mnuchin-richard-neal/index.html">made guesses as to why</a>, suggesting that perhaps he’s not as rich as he says he is, that he has financial ties to Russia, that he’s paid no income tax or that he hasn’t donated as much to charity as he said he has.</p>
<h2 data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">OK. But Why Is the Supreme Court Involved?</h2>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">Multiple House committees have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/06/trump-asks-supreme-court-block-release-his-tax-returns/4357034002/">subpoenaed</a> the accounting firm and banks used by Trump for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/03/appeals-court-refuses-block-house-subpoena-trumps-financial-records/">10 years</a> of his personal financial records, those of his three oldest children and those of parts of his businesses. The Manhattan district attorney’s office also issued <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/19/politics/trump-tax-returns-supreme-court/index.html">subpoenas</a> for those financial records in addition to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/29/waiting-for-trumps-tax-returns-dont-hold-your-breath/">eight years</a> of Trump’s business and personal tax returns. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legal battles, which have been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/05/28/trumps-tax-returns-the-legal-issues-and-possible-outcomes/">consolidated</a> into two cases —<em> <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-mazars/">Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-vance/">Trump v. Vance</a></em> — in early July. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2020/06/03/scotus-deliberates-trumps-tax-returns/#39f871e535f1">Separately</a>, the House Ways and Means Committee <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/02/house-committee-sues-treasury-for-trump-tax-returns.html">sued</a> the Treasury Department for Trump’s tax returns, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/mnuchin-says-will-defy-house-democrats-subpoena-for-trumps-tax-returns.html">defied the committee’s subpoena</a> for them.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">In late 2019, an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-never-before-seen-trump-tax-documents-show-major-inconsistencies">investigation</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/hvogell">Heather Vogell</a> of <em>ProPublica</em> and <em>WNYC</em>’s joint podcast, “<a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc">Trump, Inc</a>.,” found major inconsistencies between how three of the Trump Organization’s properties — 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trump-tower-tax-records-reveal-new-inconsistencies">Trump Tower</a> — reported financial information to New York City tax authorities and lenders.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Never-before-seen Trump tax docs show his company made his financial situation look worse when he was reporting it for tax purposes, and better when reporting it to lenders. <a href="https://t.co/jV4swLcJFj">https://t.co/jV4swLcJFj</a></p>

<p>&mdash; ProPublica (@propublica) <a href="https://twitter.com/propublica/status/1184465265561456640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The Trump Organization did not respond on the record to detailed questions provided by <em>ProPublica</em> when the investigation was originally published. A lawyer from the firm Marcus &amp; Pollack, which handles Trump’s property tax appeal filings with the city, said he was not authorized to discuss the documents. A spokeswoman for Mazars USA, which signed off on the two properties’ expense and income statements, said the firm does not comment on its work for clients. Executives with Trump’s lender, Ladder Capital, declined to be quoted for the story.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1">By appearing less profitable to tax officials and more profitable to lenders, Trump’s business could potentially reduce its tax bill and get loans with lower rates from lenders. After <em>ProPublica</em>’s findings, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked the DA’s office to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tax-inconsistencies-mayor-bill-de-blasio-new-york-city-manhattan-da">investigate</a>.<em> ProPublica</em> and <em>WNYC</em>’s investigation <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/send-us-tips">continues</a>. Given this pattern in his company’s tax records, it makes sense that people would want to see the president’s personal tax returns, too.</p>

<p>Before COVID-19, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37072"  rel="noopener noreferrer">one in three</a> American households were struggling to pay their energy bills.</p>
<p>An increase in extreme temperatures — brought on by climate change — combined with rising energy costs forced consumers to make impossible choices between keeping their lights on, purchasing food, or seeking medical care.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated this problem. As individuals <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">lost their jobs</a> at alarming rates, they were also asked, or mandated, to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus. This led to an unexpected <a href="https://www.pecanstreet.org/2020/05/covid/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">increase in residential energy use</a> and corresponding energy bills.</p>
<p>In a new nationally representative <a href="https://oneill.indiana.edu/doc/research/energy-insecurity-survey-june-2020.pdf?_ga=2.256794316.617866999.1592234109-1468293896.1585660132"  rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> of 2,381 low-income households, administered in May 2020, we find that the pandemic has deepened energy insecurity. Those who lost their jobs or had their hours reduced due to the pandemic were three times more likely to report an inability to pay an energy bill in the previous month.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/30/865413079/what-do-coronavirus-racial-disparities-look-like-state-by-state"  rel="noopener noreferrer">like COVID-19 itself</a>, energy insecurity has disproportionately worsened for vulnerable populations. African American (16 percent) and Hispanic (19 percent) households were far more likely to report difficulty paying an energy bill in the last month compared to White respondents (9 percent).</p>
<p>The problem is also worse for households with young children, those with disabled members, and those who rely on an electronic medical device.</p>
<p>Respondents who power a medical device at home were twice as likely not to be able to pay an energy bill in the past month, three times as likely to receive a notice from their utility provider that their energy is in jeopardy of being disconnected, and more than four times as likely to have their service shut off.</p>
<p>These heightened levels of energy insecurity could spur a health crisis in low-income households by exposing at-risk populations to the summer heat while simultaneously hindering their ability to seek or afford medical care. While some policies have been implemented, the situation remains dire as several of these measures are temporary; however, there is a path forward for policymakers to protect vulnerable families by suspending all utility disconnections, forgiving late payment fees, and increasing funds for energy bill assistance throughout the hot summer months.</p>
<div class="rebellt-item   col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.ehn.org/coronavirus-and-energy-2646296578.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="health-impacts" data-post-id="2646296578" data-published-at="1593522606">
<h2 data-role="headline">Health Impacts</h2>
<p>As the energy insecure population grows in the U.S., the health consequences could be calamitous, not only for those who are disabled or require an electronic medical device but also for those who live in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-019-09820-z"  rel="noopener noreferrer">poor housing conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Energy insecurity and deficient housing stock have been linked to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618301075?casa_token=L1azcPluHF8AAAAA:q7n3pr5-qiObzBGZUSXWCZo8R1tkuy3RdFbDgW8JouBtn8GKJkaT6fMJaUcttwKjEAZVDOxhwJg#bib0010"  rel="noopener noreferrer">negative health outcomes</a>, including increased rates of asthma, respiratory infections, and mental health issues, especially in households with <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/125/5/e1115?download=true"  rel="noopener noreferrer">children</a> and <a href="https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/ppi/cons-prot/2010-05-energy.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">senior citizens</a>.</p>
<p>Approximately 20 percent of survey respondents noted that their home was drafty or had poor insulation; 9 percent had holes in the floors and walls; and 7 percent did not have a working <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2020-05-28/climate-change-covid-19-heat-waves-boiling-point-newsletter-boiling-point"  rel="noopener noreferrer">air conditioner</a>. An additional 12 percent responded that they had mold, which is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114807/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">bronchitis</a>, upper respiratory tract symptoms, and <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2007/08/depression-and-household-mold"  rel="noopener noreferrer">higher rates of depression</a>.</p>
<p>The coming summer months, which are poised to be one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/climate/summer-weather-prediction.html?smid=tw-share"  rel="noopener noreferrer">hottest on record</a>, are another looming threat. If economic conditions do not improve, millions of Americans will be vulnerable. An estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/extreme-heat-guidebook.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">65,000</a> people visit the emergency room each year due to acute heat illnesses; however, this summer could be comparatively severe as 25 percent of our survey respondents either lost their health insurance entirely (15 percent) or were put on a less generous plan due to COVID-19, and 40 percent of respondents indicated that the pandemic has harmed their ability to seek medical care.</p>
<p>In response to their energy insecurity, a third of households reported taking extreme measures to maintain comfortable temperatures in their home in the last year. Some of these measures are dangerous, such as using space heaters, which are the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/US-Fire-Problem/Fire-causes/osHeating.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">leading cause of household fires</a> and associated deaths; turning on their stove; and burning trash.</p>
<p>As temperatures rise, we expect families to use methods of cooling their homes that will allow them to stay comfortable while keeping their energy costs low, such as taking cold showers, buying regular and dry ice, and using fans. Because we only expect conditions to worsen, it is critical that policymakers address energy insecurity; otherwise, the summer of 2020 will present unprecedented challenges to already-struggling American families.</p>

<h2 data-role="headline">Inadequate Policy Responses</h2>
<p>​<span>In the early weeks of the pandemic, the federal government took several steps to offer relief. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided every eligible low-income American with $1,200 in stimulus funding.</span></p>
<p>However, at the time of our survey, only 32 percent of respondents had received their check, presumably because low-income individuals are less likely to have a bank account or file their taxes through direct deposit. These delays have left many vulnerable during the early days of the pandemic, especially those that are energy insecure.</p>
<p>Our survey results imply that those households that did receive a stimulus check were more likely to be able to pay their energy bill in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Additionally, Congress extended federal unemployment insurance for those who lost their jobs because of the pandemic; yet, these benefits are <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/06/05/when-does-the-expanded-covid-19-unemployment-insurance-run-out/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">set to expire</a> at the end of July.</p>
<p>Finally, the CARES act provided $900 million in additional funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income households pay their energy bills; however, leading energy advocates are <a href="https://www.publicpower.org/periodical/article/group-calls-additional-43-billion-liheap-funding"  rel="noopener noreferrer">calling</a> for billions in additional funding to meet the growing need for assistance through the summer months.</p>
<p>State governments and utility commissions also enacted <a href="https://www.naruc.org/compilation-of-covid-19-news-resources/state-response-tracker/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">measures</a> to protect residents. As of June 2020, more than half of state governors signed orders to prevent utility shutoffs, though these protections vary greatly. They range from full moratoriums to narrow protections that leave millions susceptible to immediate disconnection and eventual debt accrual if they cannot pay their bill.</p>
<p>In addition, many of these orders are <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/June-23-2020-Issue-Brief_State-Moratoria-on-Electric-ShutOffs.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">set to expire soon</a>, with two thirds of the population projected to be unprotected by July and 88 percent unprotected by August.</p>

<h2 data-role="headline">What Can We Do? </h2>
<p>As we enter the warmest months of the year, stimulus relief is drying up and temporary protections are ending, leaving millions of families at risk for devastating financial and health-related consequences. Policymakers should consider near- and longer-term <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-0620-y"  rel="noopener noreferrer">responses</a> to help relieve the growing material hardship on families.</p>
<p>In the near-term, the federal government should impose a federal moratorium on all utility shutoffs and forgive late fees at least through the hot summer months. Congress should also increase appropriations for Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program so states can extend their utility bill assistance programs. In the longer-term, the federal government should design a stimulus package that invests in <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/pdf/S2542-4351(20)30273-7.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">clean energy technology</a> and increases funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program, which improves poor housing conditions by subsidizing energy efficient upgrades for low-income residents. An investment in the program would simultaneously help vulnerable households lower their energy bills, improve their health, and help those in the <a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Clean-Energy-Jobs-April-COVID-19-Memo-FINAL.pdf"  rel="noopener noreferrer">efficiency industry</a> get back to work as the U.S. economy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html"  rel="noopener noreferrer">reopens</a>.</p>
<p>As the economic and public health crises persist in the U.S., policymakers should prioritize helping households meet their energy needs.</p>
<p>Without relief, the repercussions could last well beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for vulnerable families.</p>

Yiannopoulos has recently gained attention for promoting conspiracy theories about both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/america-far-right-coronavirus-outbreak-trump-alex-jones">COVID-19</a> and the recent anti-police brutality <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fake-news/debunked-conspiracy-theory-about-black-lives-matter-actblue-and-democrats-can-be-traced">protests</a> across the United States. Malkin, who might be best known for writing a book arguing that Japanese internment during World War II was justified, has similarly <a href="https://angrywhitemen.org/2020/05/17/michelle-malkin-is-promoting-dangerous-nonsense-about-covid-19/">promoted</a> dangerous disinformation about COVID-19 and reduced Movement for Black Lives protesters to “invaders [and] ransackers.” None of this is out of character for a pair whose recommended reading list is rife with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, paranoid invasion fantasies, and at least one prominent fascist philosopher who explicitly denied the notion that he should rely on empirical evidence.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to dismiss the list as another stunt by attention-hungry provocateurs or an attempt to give a racist and misogynist worldview an intellectual veneer. However, it is worth paying attention to what their literary choices reveal about their ideology, the narratives that underpin it, and the connection between those narratives and real-world violence.</p>
<h2><strong>Defining American Literature</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing their list attempts to do is establish just what constitutes “American literature.” This holds true despite the fact that many of the titles were not written by Americans at all: the list’s creators are invested in defining the United States strictly as an outgrowth of pre-modern Europe, so it should come as no surprise that it includes older canonical texts by figures like Homer, Ovid, St. Augustine and Shakespeare in addition to Americana like <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> and <em>Paul Revere’s Ride</em>. The publication dates for most of its more modern literature by U.S. authors peter out by the early 1960s (Ray Bradbury’s 1963 novel <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>, for instance) with only a small handful of more recent novels, such as the self-published, remarkably poorly written 2019 <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/11/20882005/accelerationism-white-supremacy-christchurch">accelerationist</a> novel <em>Harassment Architecture</em> by Mike Ma.</p>
<p>In a tab on the Google Doc marked “HOW TO READ,” Yiannopoulos and Malkin address their readers directly, writing, “The purpose of this list is to help you build a library that will give you a firm basis in history, politics, religion and theology.” That “firm basis” manages to exclude the entire wealth of Black and Indigenous perspectives. Their understanding of modern American literature leaves no room for a Toni Morrison or a Leslie Marmon Silko, and their classics certainly have no place for a Frederick Douglass or a W.E.B. DuBois. Instead, they opt for a virtual how-to manual for white resentment and violence.</p>
<h2><strong>Invasion Narratives</strong></h2>
<p>Having established that what they understand as American literary culture is innately and almost exclusively derived from Europe, the next thing their list does is reassert the narratives of invasion, resistance and expansion that have fueled the far right imagination for decades. Possibly the list’s clearest example of an invasion narrative is recently deceased French author Jean Raspail&#8217;s 1973 novel <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>, a book Yiannopoulos and Malkin indicate is a “must read” and that has been championed by far right figures from Steve Bannon to leaders of Europe’s “<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/14/how-write-history-identitarian">identitarian</a>” movement. <em>The</em> <em>Camp</em> tells of a ramshackle “armada” of boats carrying an undifferentiated mass of impoverished Indian migrants who literally eat feces and invade Europe like zombies, displacing its white inhabitants in the process. It begins with an anecdote about a pedigreed university professor who murders a young hippie for supporting the migrants (in 1973, it was still possible for the far right to characterize academics as upholders of Western superiority, rather than its destroyers). In fact, throughout the novel, the real villains are less the migrants than the media, political and religious elites, as well as the hedonistic activists who advocate for the nameless, faceless, brown-skinned horde. In all, the novel’s plot amounts to an updated <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/the-poisonous-myth-democratic-germany-s-stab-in-the-back-legend-1.3751185">stab-in-the-back</a> myth.</p>
<p>Many on the far right have described the book as <a href="https://africasacountry.com/2019/03/camp-of-the-saints/">prophetic</a> since a new wave of migrants began arriving on Europe’s Mediterranean shores in 2015 and renewed attention has been focused on undocumented immigration at the southern border of the United States since Donald Trump’s election campaign began that same year. Pat Buchanan, who recently used <em>The Camp of the Saints</em> as a metaphor for an article about Syrian migrants on the white nationalist website VDARE, has two titles on the reading list, one of which is another “must read”; VDARE founder and white nationalist Peter Brimelow has one title on the list as well.</p>
<p>In case all of that is still too subtle, invasion narratives also dovetail neatly with the “great replacement” theory that motivated, among other things, the mass <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/16/the-inspiration-for-terrorism-in-new-zealand-came-from-france-christchurch-brenton-tarrant-renaud-camus-jean-raspail-identitarians-white-nationalism/">shootings</a> at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019. Shooter Brenton Tarrant titled his manifesto<em> The Great Replacement</em> and wrote, “We must crush immigration and deport those invaders already living on our soil.”</p>
<h2><strong>Resistance Narratives</strong></h2>
<p>Over the past year, Yiannopoulos and Malkin have been working closely with the “groyper” movement, which is essentially an “alt-right” (white nationalist) rebrand since the old label became too toxic following the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. In fact, it is groyper-in-chief Nick Fuentes’s podcast that gave the movement &#8212; and the reading list &#8212; the “America First” slogan. (Fuentes, one of the “very fine people” who attended Unite the Right, borrowed the phrase from Donald Trump’s inauguration speech.) Groypers are a constituency already moved by the overheated rhetoric of invasion and replacement, and so attacking – or, as they would say, “resisting” – the classes of people they regard as responsible for facilitating the “invasion” is a logical next step.</p>
<aside class="pullquote">The “America First&#8221; reading list is an overt attempt to instill a very narrowly defined conception of “American” culture in the minds of a young, overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male constituency.</aside>
<p>The reading list includes both Italian fascist intellectual Julius Evola’s <em>Revolt Against the Modern World</em> and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski’s manifesto <em>Industrial Society and its Future</em>, which Yiannopoulos and Malkin describe as a “rejection of the modern world.” Either one of these texts is toxic enough by itself, but in conjunction with one another, they amount to a further indication that the list provides both a theoretical rationale and a moral justification for violent attacks on such “modern” notions as democracy, egalitarianism, feminism and multiculturalism. Where Evola draws on a mythologized past of undiluted elitism and authoritarian, masculine heroism that, he argues, needs to be reclaimed (while explicitly rejecting any need for empirical evidence), Kaczynski, whose 17-year bombing campaign killed three people and injured 23 others, rails against a “leftist psychology” that he claims is symptomatic of a sick industrial society. Like many contemporary reactionaries, Kaczynski despises “political correctness,” which he says “has its stronghold among university professors.” Not coincidentally, it is university professors who were the most frequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/04/us/unabomber-s-track-victims-places-where-bombs-killed-day-for-memories-nervous.html">targets</a> of Kaczynski’s mail bombs.</p>
<p>The list also included more overt resistance narratives. It initially featured <em>The Turner Diaries</em> by William Luther Pierce (it has since been removed with no explanation given). <em>The Turner Diaries</em> is a novel about a clandestine movement of white men who use racialized terrorism and nuclear warfare to “take back” the United States from Jewish “usurpers” and what Pierce portrays as the mindless, sex-crazed Black and Latino men who act as their enforcers. Pierce was the leader of the militant white supremacist organization National Alliance and his novel inspired neo-Nazi terror group The Order, which was responsible for murdering talk radio host Alan Berg in 1984. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh evangelized the book, traveling to gun shows to <a href="https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/turner-diaries">sell</a> it (and its sequel, <em>Hunter</em>) to like-minded people; his bombing attack on the Murrah Building closely resembled a similar act described in detail in Pierce’s text. Investigators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/us/Timothy-McVeigh-Oklahoma-City-Bombing-Coronavirus.html">found</a> portions of it in his getaway car. Germany’s National Socialist Underground (NSU), which murdered 10 people and injured others in a years-long terror campaign against a mostly Turkish immigrant population, also took inspiration from <em>The Turner Diaries</em>: NSU member Uwe Mundlos translated several chapters of the book into German and a digital copy was <a href="https://www.nsu-watch.info/2016/07/the-nsu-complex-racist-murder-neo-nazi-terror-and-state-collusion-in-the-federal-republic/">found</a> on a hard drive in an apartment Mundlos and his two primary accomplices had rented while underground.</p>
<h2><strong>Expansion Narratives</strong></h2>
<p>The list also supports narratives of expansion, a central theme of “classical” fascism. It includes multiple titles that seek to “[set] the record straight about the Crusades,” a historical reference point that is ubiquitous in online far right discourse and invokes images of violent confrontation between Western warriors and Muslim “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Saracen">Saracens</a>.” Moreover, the reading list and the compilers’ commentary constantly refer to a theme of Christian superiority and its inseparability from “Western” identity. They describe one “must read” title as explaining “why the noblest virtues all rest on Christian principles” and another as articulating “how the Christian Revolution forged the Western imagination.” At the same time, Willa Cather, the lone female author on the list who isn’t a post-civil rights-era right-wing polemicist, may well be a fine writer, but Yiannopoulos and Malkin summarize their interest in her books by emphasizing her focus on “the resilient women who settled the Great Plains.” By constantly emphasizing the heroism of the colonizer while completely excluding any voice of the colonized, they make it clear that a certain kind of invasion is, in fact, acceptable to them. In brief, the sum total of the outlook supported by these texts is a justification of all past (and, presumably, present and future) colonial efforts by “virtuous” Western Christians at the expense of whatever Other is at hand.</p>
<h2><strong>Anti-Semitism, Anti-Feminism, White Nationalism</strong></h2>
<p>The list is also heavy on anti-Semitic literature (<em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, Kevin MacDonald’s <em>Culture of Critique</em>, and yes, Hitler’s <em>Mein Kampf</em>, although the latter has also been removed without explanation); masculinist or anti-feminist texts (Jack Donovan’s <em>The Way of Men</em> or several titles by Camille Paglia); and overt white nationalist screeds by the likes of Jared Taylor, Vox Day and Ann Coulter. Yiannopoulos and Malkin’s commentary is revealing here. They acknowledge that the <em>Protocols</em> are a hoax, but they say nothing about why they felt a fraudulent text produced in Tsarist Russia should be included anyway. They describe <em>Culture of Critique</em> as a “highly controversial historical survey of the roots of anti-semitism [sic].” This is, at best, a grossly misleading summary. MacDonald’s book is not so much an exploration of why other people have turned on Jews in the past, but rather why he believes Jews <em>should</em> be hated. His focus on what he believes is Jewish culpability, rather than other people’s attitudes toward Jews, is evident right in the book’s subtitle: “An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements.” In fact, <em>Culture</em> is the final book of a trilogy and the subtitles of the other two, “Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy” and “Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-Semitism” only emphasize MacDonald’s presumption that Jews are inherently, indeed genetically, predisposed to maintaining a subversive communal identity separate from whatever other populations they encounter. His analysis seldom rises above the level of condemning the “clannish” nature of international, cosmopolitan Jewry.</p>
<aside class="pullquote">Understanding the process by which the far right propagates narratives of invasion, resistance and expansion is a necessary precondition for effective opposition to their objectives.</aside>
<p>Yiannopoulos and Malkin have a history of brushing off claims of racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism by invoking their own genre of identity politics. Yiannopoulos could not possibly be anti-Semitic, because he is part <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/milo-yiannopoulos-is-the-walking-embodiment-of-bullst">Jewish</a>; Malkin obviously cannot be misogynist because she is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309101559/http:/www.aim.org/guest-column/the-war-on-conservative-women/">woman</a>. And neither of them could ever be racist because he claims he is <a href="https://hornet.com/stories/milo-yiannopoulos-wedding/">married</a> to a Black man (whose name he has never revealed and whose face has never been seen publicly) and she is <a href="https://www2.oberlin.edu/stupub/ocreview/2006/02/17/news/article4.html">Filipina</a> and married to a Jewish man. Yiannopoulos, however, was banned from Twitter for leading a viciously racist and misogynist campaign against a Black actor and notoriously <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milo-yiannopoulos-nazi-salutes-video-karaoke-richard-spencer-white-nationalists-karaoke-bar-a7987486.html">filmed</a> singing <em>America the Beautiful</em> while his erstwhile friend Richard Spencer and others gave Nazi salutes. For her part, Malkin has openly <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/conservatives-blast-michelle-malkins-anti-semitic-questions-once-admired-her-this-is-disgusting/">supported</a> anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the white nationalist aspirations of the groyper movement.</p>
<h2><strong>Metapolitics</strong></h2>
<p>One of the major tools of contemporary far right movements like the alt-right, Europe’s “identitarians,” and now the groypers is what they call “metapolitics.” It is a concept borrowed from mid-century Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci that was introduced to far right circles by Armin Mohler, a post-WWII German apologist for fascism, in a 1946 dissertation that codified what he called Germany’s interwar “Conservative Revolution.” The concept gained popularity in the European far right through the work of Mohler’s mentee Alain de Benoist and his notion of “right-wing Gramscianism.” De Benoist, the intellectual leader of France’s <em>Nouvelle Droite</em> (New Right), co-authored a “Manifesto of the New Right for the Year 2000,” which described metapolitics as, “not another way of doing politics. It has nothing to do with a ‘strategy’ that aims to impose an intellectual hegemony any more than it claims to disqualify other possible approaches or attitudes. It rests solely on the observation that ideas play a fundamental role in collective consciousnesses and, more broadly, in the entire history of men.” In practice, far right metapolitics is a process of using cultural means to make far right ideas more palatable, or what many of its practitioners refer to as shifting the “Overton window,” which represents the outer limits of acceptable discourse.</p>
<p>The “America First&#8221; reading list clearly falls within the metapolitical sphere. It is nothing if not an overt attempt to instill a very narrowly defined conception of “American” culture in the minds of a young, overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male constituency that is already predisposed to racialized and gendered resentment. As we have seen from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/new-zealand-suspect-inspired-by-far-right-french-intellectual-who-feared-nonwhite-immigration/2019/03/15/8c39fba4-6201-4a8d-99c6-aa42db53d6d3_story.html">Christchurch</a> to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/el-paso-shooting-racist-lie-great-replacement-fuels-terrorist-attacks">El Paso</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/utoya-survivors-story-anders-breivik">Oslo</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/pittsburgh-shooting-robert-bowers.html">Pittsburgh</a>, their cohort is already prone to explosive and deadly violence.</p>
<p>It is possible to dismiss the “America First” reading list as just another manifestation of the far right echo chamber and the urge for people like Yiannopoulos and Malkin to keep drawing attention to themselves. However, it also provides useful insights into the mindset of their “groyper” constituency and related far right sects, as well as the pathways that lead from their exclusionary ideology to violent action. Three years after Unite the Right and in the midst of both a pandemic and a rapidly evolving push for anti-racist social and political change, understanding the process by which the far right propagates narratives of invasion, resistance and expansion in the interest of establishing its own sense of legitimacy is still a necessary precondition for effective opposition to their objectives.</p>

Teams releasing players. Some team owners continue to pay Minor League players, while others convey “tough luck” sentiments and cut the players off. More than 40 Minor League teams to be eliminated; untold damage for local economies as a result. This is our new reality in the age of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the Clinton LumberKings, a Minor League baseball team in Clinton, Iowa. Minor League baseball has been played in this town since 1937. With its working-class roots, Clinton’s Minor League team has become part of the town’s identity, providing affordable entertainment and a glimpse at stars before they become stars. After all, it is hundreds of miles from the nearest Major League Baseball (MLB) team. And it has also employed scores of workers for almost 100 years, from front office personnel to concession workers to ushers.</p>
<p>Now Clinton’s team, <a href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/all-42-teams-reportedly-up-for-elimination-in-mlbs-minor-league-reduction-proposal/">along with 41 others</a>, are on a list of teams to be eliminated, and Minor League Baseball may never be played there again.</p>
<p>All of this happening in the context of the COVID-19/economic crises, with the future of the Minor Leagues — indeed, the future of baseball — up in the air.</p>
<p>There are three points to make here. First, just as with others in big business, Major League Baseball owners are taking advantage of this situation in order to bring about changes that they knew would have been met with steep resistance under other circumstances. Author Naomi Klein speaks of “disaster capitalism,” in which those of wealth and avarice take advantage of disasters in order to advance their agendas and/or make changes that would have been difficult to have made otherwise. We saw this in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. In today’s context, what is happening to Minor Leaguers and the MLB as a whole is representative of a design that the MLB owners had in place. Months prior to COVID-19, MLB owners were <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/18/mlb-minor-league-system-changes-proposal">seriously</a> <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2019/11/21/20973264/mlb-minor-league-realignment-proposal-teams-near-me">discussing</a> cutting the number of teams and cutting the number of draft rounds. There were mobilizations taking place against them, bad press for the owners, and then the plague hit.</p>
<p>The changes underway may result in Minor League jobs never returning. We may be looking at a dramatic and pro-corporate restructuring of baseball as an industry after both the pandemic and economic crises end, unless there is a loud and organized public response. This is just as true for workers outside of baseball &#8212; be they journalists, retail workers, meatpackers or public sector workers &#8212; as for those in baseball, including (but not limited to) the players.</p>
<p>Second, baseball may be a game, but what is unfolding for the Minor Leaguers is far from a game or a joke. The lives and careers of thousands of players and other workers in the industry are unraveling as the uncertainty of their situations grow in intensity. The pay for the highest-level Minor Leaguers — those at the Triple-A level, one step from the Major Leagues — was already <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/nba-g-league-salary-increase-mlb-minor-league-save-americas-pastime-act-spending-bill-congress-trump/wqqkm6qzf22i1izj66k4kxf07">outrageously low</a> at <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/minor-league-baseball-pay-fair-labor-standards-act-minimum-wage-lawsuit-kyle-johnson">$12,000 a year</a>. The MLB requires them to conduct much work with no compensation (such as during spring training), purchase their own equipment, gain pitiful amounts of per diem while on the road, and share uncomfortably close quarters with other players due to a lack of resources to live on their own.</p>
<p>Third, this dismal situation mirrors that faced by millions of workers across the U.S. who have lost their jobs or, in other cases, been compelled to work under unhealthy conditions in the midst of this pandemic. Not only are we forced to protect ourselves through social distancing, but families are forced to give up work, in many cases, in order to take care of their children. Already stretched budgets — due to the polarization of wealth we have been seeing grow in this country over the last 40 years — have reached the snapping point. Minor Leaguers are not cresting this situation but are being swamped by this catastrophe.</p>
<p>Major League players are also facing a pounding by the MLB owners but, at least in their case, the Major Leaguers have the protection of a union, the Major League Baseball Players Association. In the case of the Minor Leagues, there is nothing, and the owners know that they can roll over the players and the communities where these Minor League teams are located with little risk unless something is done right now. That means organization and it means building coalitions. A step in that direction has been our founding of a new nonprofit, <a href="https://www.advocatesforminorleaguers.com/ourfight">Advocates for Minor Leaguers</a> which, while not a labor union, seeks to provide a voice for Minor Leaguers and to work to better their working conditions. This struggle is not about enriching Minor League players. It is about displaying the same concern that we have for all workers who are losing their jobs, their homes and their futures.</p>
<p>Now is the time for action, not pity.</p>

Democrats assembled in their usual formation to say it did not go far enough. But amid crystal-clear calls from protesters in the streets to defund the police, there is bipartisan agreement among national politicians to do just the opposite: fund them. As presumptive Democratic candidate and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/09/17/the-untold-story-joe-biden-pushed-ronald-reagan-to-ramp-up-incarceration-not-the-other-way-around/">major architect of mass incarceration</a> Joe Biden <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/11/defund-the-police-joe-biden-cops/">said</a> recently, “Every single police department should have the money they need to institute real reforms.”</p>
<p>History tells us that mass incarceration &#8212; and the police who act as its foot soldiers &#8212; have always been a bipartisan project. Political scientist Naomi Murakawa documents in her book <em><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-first-civil-right-9780199892785?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America</a></em> how the midcentury movement for “police professionalization” marked an earlier consensus to fund the police. “Some saw police funding as a way to <em>repress </em>rioting and law-breaking; others saw police funding as a way to <em>suppress </em>impetuses for rioting by improving ‘police-community- relations.” Both saw resources for policing &#8212; not its defunding and dissolution &#8212; as the answer.</p>
<p>These staged partisan disagreements on reform are a counter-revolutionary tactic. They aim to further enshrine policing into the fabric of our society. As historian Stuart Schrader points out, “police reform is not designed to help citizens. It is designed to help police.” Police reform is a time-honored counter-insurgency measure to quell rebellion.</p>
<p>During the Watts rebellion in 1965, with the South Los Angeles neighborhood in flames, similar reforms were proposed: citizen review boards, bias trainings, diversifying the police force. And the police murder of a Black Muslim man, Ronald Stokes, years earlier — one that many viewed as the kindling for the rebellion — is particularly instructive in our current moment.</p>
<p>The surveillance of the daily lives of Muslims leading up to Stokes’s death and the liberal reforms which precipitated and followed it, can inform current discussions about reform and abolition. Indeed, the murder of Ronald Stokes happened in a city whose police department was heralded as a national model for police professionalization and reform. </p>
<h2>The Fatal Results of Police Professionalization</h2>
<p>On the evening of April 27, 1962, Monroe Jones and Fred Jingles were unloading suits out of the back of a Buick in front of the Nation of Islam’s (NOI’s) mosque in South Los Angeles when two white officers stopped them. What was described in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> as a “blazing gunfight” and a “riot” left seven unarmed Muslims shot by police. One man, William Rogers, was paralyzed from the waist down, and mosque secretary Ronald Stokes was shot through the heart at close range while walking towards a white police officer with his hands raised in prayer. As the others lay on the ground handcuffed and bleeding, they held hands and chanted <em>Allāhu akbar</em>, “God is most great.”</p>
<aside class="pullquote">Police reform is a time-honored counter-insurgency measure to quell rebellion.</aside>
<p>But before being hailed with police bullets that night, Muslims were surveilled for years and routinely harassed for selling newspapers. Then, as now, policing was defined by a continuum of violence against communities, rather than their protection from it. Police Chief William Parker himself proudly admitted that “we have been watching [them] with concern for a long time.”</p>
<p>Parker was a leading national reformer in the push for police professionalization. He was also famous for popularizing the term the “thin blue line” and <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/police-have-long-history-of-responding-to-black-movements-by-playing-the-victim/">describing police as the “greatest dislocated minority in America</a>.” He did this all while overseeing a police force so brutal that the generally moderate civil rights leader Roy Wilkins compared Los Angeles police as “next to those in Birmingham, Alabama.”</p>
<p>The Monday before Stokes was murdered, 10 Muslim men drove to the University of California, Los Angeles campus to sell copies of the NOI’s newspaper, <em>Muhammad Speaks</em>. There, they were hassled by police officers who asked whether they were students and demanded their identification. Arthur Coleman refused. Four days later, Coleman had his head lacerated by a gun butt and was shot in his chest and the base of his penis by Donald Weese, the same officer who killed Stokes. He was then handcuffed and left lying on the ground. Policing the sale of newspapers on a college campus was part of the daily surveillance and profiling that served as the precursor for the fatal violence later that week.</p>
<p>This is not a contradiction. Huddled together under the umbrella of police professionalization was racial bias training and wiretapping, crime data and racial and religious profiling. The purpose of police professionalization was to broaden the scope of policing while shielding it from public scrutiny and oversight.</p>
<h2>The Everyday Violence of Policing</h2>
<p>Exceptional violence begins with the quotidian. The daily policing of everyday Black life is a sustain pedal punctuated by the staccato notes of police murder which have catalyzed current uprisings. Trayvon Martin was killed over Skittles and a can of iced tea. Eric Garner was choked to death over selling cigarettes. Sandra Bland’s death was prompted by a traffic stop. George Floyd was murdered over a $20 bill. Rayshard Brooks was sleeping in his car. The murder of Ronald Stokes began with two men unloading suits from the back of a Buick.</p>
<aside class="pullquote">The purpose of police professionalization was to broaden the scope of policing while shielding it from public scrutiny and oversight.</aside>
<p>When Jones and Jingles were stopped and asked by police “if they were Muslims,” they demanded to know why they were being questioned. One officer cited high rates of crime in the area and suggested the suits may have been stolen. A scuffle ensued, and a Black off-duty police officer intervened by slamming a blackjack club against one of the men’s heads. What began as two officers questioning men who were unloading laundry, ended with a half-dozen men shot and one dead. Officer Donald Weese alone was responsible for shooting five of the men. Yet, the grand jury ruled Stokes’s murder justifiable homicide.</p>
<p>If history is any guide, liberal professionalization reforms such as community relations training, racial diversification and data analysis will not change the violent outcome of police murder. To the contrary, the backdrop to the deadliest case of police violence in the 30-year history of the Nation of Islam included all three.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, it was the victims of police violence, not police, who eventually went on trial. The state brought 40 counts of assault and resisting arrest against 14 defendants. The trial set the record for longest jury deliberation in Los Angeles history. Over 18 anguishing days, Malcolm X and supporters held vigils outside the courthouse while 200 police with nightsticks patrolled around them. In the end, 11 of the 14 men were found guilty. Herbert Rogers, whose son William was sentenced on assault charges while sitting in a wheelchair paralyzed from police bullets, summed up the trial most succinctly: “You can’t get a fair trial in a white man’s court.”</p>

<h2>Police Reforms Fail Because They Were Never Designed to Succeed</h2>
<p>When the Watts Rebellion erupted three years later in response to police violence, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/opinion/50-years-later-we-still-havent-learned-from-watts.html">considered the murder of Ronald Stokes the origin</a>. Ruth Robinson, a Black teacher who was herself a victim of police brutality and had tried to sue the city for years, recalled joining the organized fight against police violence after Stokes’s killing. Longtime civil rights attorney Loren Miller, who represented the Muslims at trial, had ominously forecast a year before Watts that “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4zuYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=Loren+Miller+%22violence+in+Los+Angeles+is+inevitable.+Nothing+can+or+will+be+done+about+it+until+after+the+fact&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UK1SKO0zZ_&amp;sig=ACfU3U3pISwvtZJj5dIAS6iZ4lZgbO1H6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivgvS1_ZrqAhWMsZ4KHcBeBP8Q6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Loren%20Miller%20%22violence%20in%20Los%20Angeles%20is%20inevitable.%20Nothing%20can%20or%20will%20be%20done%20about%20it%20until%20after%20the%20fact&amp;f=false">violence in Los Angeles is inevitable</a> and nothing can or will be done about it until after the fact.”</p>
<p>Between 1963 and 1965 alone, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0811-kelley-watts-civil-society-20150811-story.html">police had killed 60 Black people in Los Angeles</a>; 25 were unarmed and 27 were shot were in the back. Yet the reforms proposed after Stokes’s murder in 1962 were again mirrored in 1965: civilian review boards, diversified police forces, community relations committees, speaker’s bureaus &#8212; in short, pacification projects. Even the liberal-minded Miller condemned the McCone report commissioned after Watts as a “bitter disappointment” which “prescribes aspirin where surgery is required.”</p>
<p>What does this mean in our current moment that liberal police reforms preceded and followed Stokes’s murder? When Malcolm X spoke to the press about the killing, he emphasized that “<a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7041/">this happened in Los Angeles</a>.” A police force known nationally for its modernization and professionalization did not change its reputation among Black Angelinos as a violent occupying army. It did not stop Ronald Stokes from being murdered, or William Rogers from being paralyzed, or Watts from burning.</p>
<p>As Angela Y. Davis <a href="https://theslot.jezebel.com/angela-davis-calls-for-abolition-feminism-now-1844032657">pointed out</a>, we are “trapped on a treadmill of reform.” But reform does not stop the killings. Although reformist solutions such as #8CantWait focus on banning various forms of excessive force, daily policing is predicated on the possibility &#8212; indeed the inevitability of &#8212; excessive force. It is for this reason that historian Micol Seigel has <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/violence-work">described policing as “violence work.”</a></p>
<p>Mariame Kaba <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html">cautioned</a> that when “the streets calm and people suggest once again that we hire more Black police officers or create more civilian review boards, I hope that we remember all the times those efforts have failed.”</p>
<p>They have failed because they were never designed to succeed. There is no “excessive use of force” uncoupled from the everyday violence of surveilling Black life. The murder of Ronald Stokes was inextricably bound in the harassment of Black Muslim men selling newspapers and unloading suits. Those practices were embedded in reforms. To truly end police violence, we must end policing itself.</p>

<p>Howard Thurman in his sermons on&nbsp;<em>Jesus and the Disenfranchised</em>&nbsp;poses an interesting dilemma about valuing country over life. In his words:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;During times of war hatred becomes quite respectable, even though it has to masquerade often under the guise of patriotism.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us not become haters of one another&#8211;haters of our shared humanity&#8211; under any guise at all. July 4 is a time to remember that, to quote the late feminist-nonviolent activist, Barbara Deming, &#8220;We are all part of one another.&#8221; Or in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, &#8220;We are caught up in an inescapable web of mutuality.&#8221; </p>



<p><strong>Our mutuality, our belonging-ness with one another, our capacity to root out hatred in whatever guises it poses itself as &#8220;respectable&#8221;&nbsp;is a key part of the &#8220;inner significance&#8221; of nonviolence. We refuse to hate.</strong></p>



<p>But what about &#8220;those angry people&#8221;? Or, what about my OWN anger, forget about those other people? Let&#8217;s be very clear: anger is not hatred. Anger is a form of energy, while hatred [of life, of people to be precise] is a form of consciousness entrapped by a fundamental delusion of pure division with *almost* no&nbsp;escape. Anger can go in the direction of hatred, most certainly, but it can also transform into love, a state where hatred cannot live because love is a fundamental awareness of our fullness&nbsp;through each other. Love, when properly understood, transforms hatred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonviolent energy hides in our emotional states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passivity can&#8211;must&#8211; be roused into action<br>and action, while better than being merely passive&#8211;<br>can be&nbsp;directed into channels that build bridges<br>(to mix and use a metaphor from john a. powell of UC Berkeley&#8217;s Otherness and Belonging Institute).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we should not judge others at all, we certainly should not judge people&#8211;our ourselves&#8211; for feeling angry about injustice! Nor should we *fear* each other&#8217;s anger or our own,&nbsp;or conflate our expressions of anger in moments of escalation or just plain frustration at times&#8211;with hatred.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Instead, let&#8217;s find ways of helping one another put fear and&nbsp;anger to good use, or show people who are passive that there are ways to get involved where their contribution can make a difference.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If we stifle or waste this energy we lose a precious, raw resource that has the potential to do so much good for re-balancing our systems that are so weighted down in oppressive practices, biases, and broken relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we do this? We can *start* by listening. Listening to ourselves and knowing what we are feeling without judging it. We can also commit ourselves to learning. Learn about how people around the world have roused themselves from apathy or passivity and channeled their anger, frustration, or sense of worthlessness&nbsp;into nonviolent action. Learn their names, learn their stories, learn the lessons they want to share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ask and attempt to answer: What roused them from passivity to a desire for action to a commitment to&nbsp;<em>nonviolent</em>&nbsp;action? What motivated them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, let&#8217;s personalize and embed a true sense of dignity within all of&nbsp;our relationships: tell and show each other how we want to be treated, be firm about how we are willing and not willing treat others, and examine how to show our mutuality, our interconnectedness, our love for one another and of life itself through nonviolence from <strong>wherever we are right now.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>With Metta,&nbsp;</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.3">The NYPD’s responsiveness has “steadily gotten worse,” stated the memo, which was obtained by <em>ProPublica</em>. The memo warned that “the situation is untenable.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.4">The memo’s authors wrote that lack of access to body-worn camera footage reflects a broader issue. “The struggle for BWC,” or body-worn camera footage, they wrote, “is the struggle for the future of civilian oversight.” (<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6980787-CCRB-Memo-on-Body-Cam-Footage.html">Here is the memo.</a>)</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">If investigators get bodycam footage, CCRB data <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccrb/downloads/pdf/policy_pdf/annual_bi-annual/2019_semi-annual.pdf">shows</a>, they are far more likely to get to the bottom of a case. Without it, they usually can’t, and often end up closing cases without finding out what really happened.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">A spokesperson for the NYPD said the coronavirus pandemic and other “unprecedented events” have caused the police to deploy “many officers into the field and away from administrative assignments.” The NYPD noted that it has recently shared 703 videos related to complaints stemming from the police protests. (Here is the NYPD’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6980793-NYPD-Statement-on-Body-Worn-Camera-Footage.html">full statement</a>.)</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.2">While the pandemic has exacerbated the issue, the NYPD’s responsiveness began to be problematic much earlier. In early 2019, the percentage of alleged abuse cases waiting for NYPD footage spiked more than fourfold, to 37%. A CCRB report <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccrb/downloads/pdf/policy_pdf/annual_bi-annual/2019_semi-annual.pdf">noted</a> “mounting delays in the receipt of key evidence, especially BWC footage.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.3">The delays in turning over footage can have a significant effect on whether police officers are held accountable when people come forward with accusations of misconduct, such as racially profiling or pistol-whipping a person. There’s an 18-month statute of limitations on bringing any discipline charges against NYPD officers, whether the charges are initiated by the CCRB or by the department itself.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.4">Multiple entities have responsibility for investigating abuse and corruption by NYPD officers. The NYPD has its own internal investigators, and local and federal prosecutors, of course, can also bring criminal charges.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.5">But it’s the CCRB that’s supposed to provide an independent venue for complaints against police. The agency has the authority to investigate everything from officers being discourteous to police violence against civilians. It was the CCRB’s investigation of the 2014 death of Eric Garner after an officer used a chokehold that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/13/how-civilian-oversight-new-york-police-salvaged-some-justice-eric-garner/">ultimately led</a> the NYPD to fire the officer.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.6">As ProPublica recently detailed, the NYPD has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/my-family-saw-a-police-car-hit-a-kid-on-halloween-then-i-learned-how-nypd-impunity-works">nearly complete discretion</a> over how much it cooperates with CCRB investigations. While the CCRB can recommend punishment, the police commissioner can and often does decide to do otherwise.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.7">That discretion extends to footage from body-worn cameras. CCRB investigators have to submit individual requests. The NYPD has often responded to the requests by saying the footage doesn’t exist — only for the CCRB to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccrb/downloads/pdf/policy_pdf/issue_based/20200227_BWCReport.pdf">later discover</a> it does.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.8">The CCRB and NYPD worked out an agreement last year to allow civilian investigators to be in the room while officers search for footage. Implementation of the deal has been delayed by the pandemic. When it does start, CCRB investigators still won’t have direct access to the files.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.9">Other cities, such as Washington, San Francisco and New Orleans, have created a much simpler process. They let civilian oversight investigators go right into the systems that store footage. “I can go and check myself,” a New Orleans civilian oversight official <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/police-misconduct-body-worn-camera-videos-slow-come/">told</a> <em>WNYC</em> last year. “I can search by officer, I can search by location, I can search by date and time.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.10">The CCRB staffers who sent the memo wrote that their agency should have the same setup. They urged the agency’s leadership to “seize the moment and do everything possible in its power to obtain unmediated direct access to BWC footage.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.11">Asked for comment, the chair of the CCRB, the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/about/board/fred-davie.page">Rev. Frederick Davie</a>, said in a statement that he agrees that investigators should have direct access. “The Board and staff have long believed there should be unfettered access to body-worn camera footage, and I share their concern about the backlog,” said Davie, who was appointed as chair in 2018 by Mayor Bill de Blasio. “As we have seen in recent weeks with the influx of police misconduct allegations, direct access is a necessary tool for the CCRB to fairly and impartially investigate these matters as efficiently as possible.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">New York’s CCRB has long sought more authority and independence but has faced <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/about/history.page">opposition</a> from the NYPD and police unions. When the agency was created nearly 70 years ago, it was led by NYPD officials. The CCRB now has a 15-member board, appointed by the mayor, the City Council and the police commissioner. It has about 200 investigators and other staff, who field about 7,000 complaints per year.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">Concerns about the NYPD’s handling of body-worn camera footage not only <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/police-misconduct-body-worn-camera-videos-slow-come/">predate the pandemic</a>, they go beyond the backlog. A CCRB <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccrb/downloads/pdf/policy_pdf/issue_based/20200227_BWCReport.pdf">report</a> from February that focused on bodycams said that a change in NYPD policies last year “led to an increase in the number of cases where BWC footage was either redacted or withheld in its entirety.”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.2">The report also said that the CCRB had found instances “where officers have used signals to prevent or halt the recording of police misconduct.” In other instances, the report said, officers warned colleagues that the cameras were on: “Officers were frequently heard using phrases such as, ‘I went Hollywood,’ ‘Green,’ ‘I’m/We’re live,’ and ‘I’m hot.’”</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.3">Bodycam footage can be quite valuable for officers facing allegations of abuse. The rate that the CCRB substantiates abuse more than doubles if it has footage — from 14% to 32%. But the rate of investigators concluding that complaints are unfounded also jumps: It triples, from 4% to 15%.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.4">One of the authors of the recent CCRB warning on the backlog, Olas Carayannis, also circulated an internal <a href="https://brooklyneagle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/20190710_boardmtg_BWC_memo-2-1.pdf">memo</a> last year about the very same issue. “Unless there is a significant change, the backlog of CCRB requests for video evidence will continue to increase and will impair the CCRB’s ability to complete investigations within the 18-month statute of limitations,” Carayannis wrote.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.5">“The CCRB is currently in a position where it is missing necessary evidence in hundreds of cases, and is in jeopardy of exceeding the statute of limitations in those cases,” he added. (Carayannis did not return messages from <em>ProPublica</em>.)</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.6">The backlog has gotten worse since then. As of last week, the new memo says, there were about 1,100 unfilled requests for footage.</p>

The Black Hills, where Mount Rushmore is carved, are unceded territory in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 and acknowledged by a 1980 Supreme Court ruling in the United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians.</aside>
<p class="sk1e77gwm">More than 100 treaty defenders and other protesters gathered on a highway leading to Mount Rushmore on Friday ahead of President Donald Trump’s speech at the monument.</p>
<section class="sk139g9fe">
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="6">The group blocked the road, holding banners and chanting slogans such as “We can’t breathe” and proclaiming treaty rights. They carried signs with messages such as, “End 500 years of Genocide,” and “It’s a good day to do the right thing.&#8221; </p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="7">At one point, Native women in ribbon skirts created a line across the highway, behind them members of NDN Collective, a nonprofit Native advocacy organization, parked white vans across the road and deflated the tires. Protesters later removed the wheels and climbed on top of the vans, shouting &#8220;Land back!&#8221; <strong tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="9"></strong></p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="11">The gathering took place near a checkpoint at Highways 16/244 where ticket holders for Trump’s South Dakota event were being screened. Some treaty defenders got into heated exchanges with people driving to Mount Rushmore.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="13">Around 5 p.m. local time, law enforcement started telling defenders to vacate the area or face arrest, saying the blocking of traffic was an unlawful assembly. They directed them to head to a designated “free speech zone.&#8221;</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="13">Law enforcement officers dressed in riot gear held shields and formed a line across the road, pushing up against a group of protesters. </p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="15">&#8220;We don’t need them to give us permission to do this on our land; we intend to stay here indefinitely throughout the night,&#8221; said Nick Tilsen, Oglala Lakota, of NDN Collective. &#8220;Mount Rushmore is a symbol of white supremacy. When you carve out four white men who conducted genocide against Native people in this sacred place, it is fundamentally wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="16">Some people began to disperse but later returned, as the vans continued blocking the road. Law enforcement then brought in tow trucks to haul them away. </p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="18">Trump supporters standing behind and near the police line shouted at treaty defenders. A man claiming to be a veteran repeatedly offered his help to police.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="19">After the vans were towed, a small group of treaty defenders continued blocking the highway, holding a large “#LandBack” banner.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="19">At 7 p.m., police arrested them, using zipties to secure their hands behind their backs and leading them off the road. Trump supporters shouted accusations that the defenders were funded by George Soros, founder and chairman of Open Society Foundations and frequent target of right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="21">About 15 people were arrested, <a tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="22" href="https://apnews.com/e4725ee4f6c777273a4b5dc83ab57823"  rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Associated Press</em></a> reported.

<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="24">Several groups of Natives had planned to travel to the monument to voice their opposition to Trump’s visit, his policies that are seen as challenges to tribal sovereignty and the very presence of Mount Rushmore, which features faces of American presidents carved into a mountain held sacred by many tribes in the region.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="25">Among those gathered at the highway Friday was Krystal Two Bulls, an Army veteran and founder of Voices of the Sacred, an organization aimed at empowering Native youth.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="26">“We need to be bringing out the roots of what we’re talking about,” she said in a livestreamed video of the protest. “This country was founded on white supremecy,” including the genocide of Natives and slave labor of Black people.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="26">“This is a major convergence that we’re seeing today,” said Two Bulls, Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne. “All these people standing together across the country.”</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="31">The Black Hills are part of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, and the country’s highest court ordered compensation in the millions of dollars to the Lakota for their illegal seizure, an offer the Lakota have refused for decades. They instead want the Black Hills returned to tribal authority.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="32">Mount Rushmore is considered a national memorial by the National Park Service and is the state’s prized tourist destination, attracting nearly 3 million visitors each year.</p>
<p tmlembeds="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" users="[object Object]" index="33">The South Dakota Department of Tourism created a lottery system allowing 7,500 people to attend Friday night&#8217;s program, in which fireworks were scheduled to be set off at the monument for the first time since 2009. </p>

Or maybe it&#8217;s a comment about race, or body size, or physical ability, (Insert your own scenario here).

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Friday, July 10 from 9:30-11:30 am PST, feminist-antiracist trainers, Sally Eck and Roberta Hunte from Portland State University will join the Metta Center&#8217;s hope tank to offer an introductory workshop on &#8220;calling in,&#8221; how we can show up for each other and interrupt language and behavior that can cause others hurt and harm, while expanding our circles of belonging and building &#8216;beloved community.&#8217;&nbsp;</p>

These much-needed actions highlight not only modern-day police abuse but also the sordid history of white supremacy and racial violence in this country. Instead of celebrating a false narrative of American struggle for liberty and justice for all, we should be out in the streets protesting against the continued killings by the police of Black people and we should wrestle with this country&#8217;s true history of racial violence and oppression that has led us to this much needed reckoning.</p>
<p>The murders of Rayshard Brooks, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are the most recent additions to a far too numerous lists of victims of U.S. racial violence, the legacy of the nation’s white supremacist origins that remains part of its life blood. Today when we have Black people killed by the police or self-appointed white vigilantes, many will yell that the system is broken. But this displays a fundamental flaw in any analysis of what the purpose of policing has been since its inception.</p>
<p>Racial violence is embedded in the fabric of this country’s history. From Columbus first bringing <a href="https://www.history.com/news/american-slavery-before-jamestown-1619#:~:text=The%20arrival%20of%20the%20first,as%20early%20as%20the%201500s.">enslaved Africans</a> to the Caribbean (1490s) in the newly “discovered” lands; to the Spanish-controlled settlement first using slave labor on the mainland of North America (1526) in what would later become South Carolina, bringing in 100 enslaved Africans, all who shortly after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/09/07/before-there-was-mystery-first-enslaved-africans-what-became-us/">revolted and escaped</a>; to British colonial enslavement/indentured servitude (1619) starting in Jamestown that by the 1660s grew into the system of chattel slavery that would remain in this land for following 200 years. Racialized control and violence (branding, rape, separation of families, whipping) over Africans, later to be re-classified by many different names, has been the common thread of history for Black people in this country and hemisphere.</p>
<p>The subjugation of Black people was codified in the founding of this nation. As part of the U.S. Constitution, Article 4 section 2, known as the Fugitive Slave Clause, states a &#8220;person held to service or labor&#8221; (read labor as enslaved African) “flees to another state [is] to be returned to his or her master in the state from which that person escaped….” This was later codified in the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act, which passed Congress and was signed by George Washington to give direction the constitutional statute. To enforce such federal and local laws, a policing system in the South was slowly established. <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-racist-roots-of-american-policing-from-slave-patrols-to-traffic-stops-112816">Slave patrols</a> of white volunteers were created to enforce the laws of slavery &#8212; from punishing enslaved Africans for “breaking” plantation rules to rounding up Black people who they believed to have escaped, and crushing uprisings when enslaved Africans revolted in order to “protect” the private property of the master class.</p>
<p>When slavery ended, only after a bloody civil war, new laws were erected post-Reconstruction to re-enslave Black people. In addition to a lopsided sharecropping arrangement that kept Black people forever in debt to the plantation owners, new vagrancy laws and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/black-code">Black codes</a> were established and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/exploiting-black-labor-after-the-abolition-of-slavery-72482">prison leasing system</a> was born. As many as 200,000 <a href="https://slaverybyanothername.com/">Black people</a> (mostly men) were arrested by the police, tried and sentenced by the courts and sent back to plantation life. This conspiracy of interest by white plantation owners, business people and white elected officials known as “Redemption” was both born as a way to gain cheap labor and to strip Black people of their voting and citizenship rights recently gained from the 14th and 15th Amendments. When the police were not enforcing these laws in uniform, many in the South were a part of white terrorist groups like the Ku Klux Klan that killed, lynched, maimed and harassed Black people in the name of white supremacy. This continued to be the norm for Black life for close to another 100 years in the South. With the codification of Jim Crow laws, the police saw it as their duty, custom and culture to uphold these laws.</p>
<p>Although most forms of vigilante-style racial violence have been lessened from the period of overt slave catching, bounty hunting and terrorist lynch mobs, the notable exceptions still exist. Many Southern states have gone out of their way to extend the definition of “self-defense” from the castle doctrine of protecting one’s home or protecting oneself from imminent threat with a proportional response, to “stand your ground laws,” which allow the use of deadly force for perceived danger. White people have felt empowered to use these laws to stop Black people, like the slave catcher of the past, and interrogate them. When these Black people don’t respond well to being forced to stop by strangers, these white men have shot them and claimed the defense of standing their ground even when they are shooting unarmed Black people. Similar to lynch mobs, these individuals feel it is their right to control and terrorize Black people. Clearly, these laws were meant to give whites the feeling of acting “under the color of law&#8221; when confronting mostly young Black men.</p>
<p>The modern over-policing of Black communities started with the Great Migration North in the early 1900s onward, the pushing of Black people into certain communities, and white flight, followed by a decrease in most city services except for one city agency which increased its presence &#8212; the local police. There were plenty of police patrolling the neighborhoods of the urban slum. The primary contacts the state had with its Black citizens was through cops on the beat who, through the use of racialized violence, enforced the rules and laws of the street and corner life. </p>
<p>Places where I grew up myself included dilapidated apartments and high-rise public housing where there was never enough work, health care or space but always enough cops looking to make arrests and to control the movement of Black people. Most urban uprisings of the second half of the last century were connected to incidents of police brutality in the community. During this period, the aggressive tactics of the police gave us the form of police brutality and racialized violence we see today and the creation of the modern prison-industrial complex, where Black men in particular make up 6 percent of the U.S. population but 33 percent of the overall prison population. The killing of Black people, the most horrific form of this violence, became a staple of white police enforcement and intimidation. Prior to phone cameras and a news media interested in covering such stories, most of the time these deaths became a memory for a mother, wife, brother, sister and child &#8212; but not the country.</p>
<p>Yesteryear’s white supremacy still informs the rules of engagement. The police both historically and contemporaneously serve to control the physical movement of Black people, support a system of controlled labor through arrest policies and attempt to create an atmosphere of fear by wielding an overwhelming use of force. In other words, the system is not broken but working as intended when first introduced as a slave-catching mechanism to prevent enslaved Africans from escaping the conditions of servitude in plantation life. That system has developed into the professionalized and militarized system of control we have today that, instead of working for plantation and slave owners, has morphed into a system protecting the private property of the larger capitalist class while policing Black movement and aspirations.</p>
<p>There needs to be a rethinking of policing in this country, one that includes the calls for defunding and abolition, but also takes on the question of who has power and control over whatever policing apparatus is with us. That power should be in the hands of the community being policed.</p>
<p>The Fourth of July is best used by mobilizing and organizing to tell America that it is time to reexamine its past and develop a new community-centered approach to ending racial violence and police brutality in this country.</p>

Here’s a selection of some happenings—fleeting or otherwise—in the Buddhist world this week.</p>
<h2><b>Uighur People Face Forced Sterilization </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Uighur people, ethnic Muslims who live in China’s far west region of Xinjiang, have faced discrimination, forced internment in </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-education camps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other state-sanctioned violence in recent years. Now, more information is coming to light about Chinese government-led efforts to systematically curb its Uighur population. According to the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AP), Chinese authorities are using “draconian measures” to curb birth rates among Uighurs and other minorities. These measures include pregnancy checks, and forces intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and even abortion. While individual people had spoken out about forced birth control, interviews and data taken from an AP investigation of government statistics, state documents, and interviews with 30 ex-internment camp detainees, family members, and a former detention camp instructor, show that forced sterilization practices are much more widespread than previously understood. Some experts are now calling China’s attempt to stifle Uighur birth rates a form of “demographic genocide.” </span></p>

We’re a new nonprofit and providing affordable classes is important to us, especially during the pandemic when so many families are going stir-crazy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inner Kids offers two classes each week in Spanish, in partnership with Mexico-based mindfulness organization </span><a href="https://innerkids.org/who-we-are/inner-kids-collaborative-founding-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AtentaMente</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and also hosts a weekly class for caregivers of children with autism. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t be prouder or more grateful to be part of this fantastic collaborative of volunteer teachers, all of whom are working their hearts out to bring this project to life,” Greenland said. To register, check out Inner Kids’ schedule </span><a href="https://innerkids.org/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ted Grimsrud</strong></p>
<p><em>[Sermon preached at Harrisonburg Unitarian Universalist Fellowship—</em><em>December 1, 2019]</em></p>
<p>You would think that given how important God is to so many people, that we’d find it easier to talk about God. But it seems that even though people act as though, of course, God is real and we all know what we mean by God, very few people are all that articulate when they actually try to talk about God. It’s even difficult to find good jokes about God—when I searched the internet, this is the best I could do: God was talking to an angel and said, “I just figured out how to rotate the Earth so it creates this really incredible 24-hour period of alternating light and darkness.” The angel said, “That’s great. So, what are you going to do next?” God says, “Well, I think I’ll call it a day.”</p>
<p>I suppose for many of us, our understanding of God has evolved quite a bit as we have gone through life; mine has. One of the things I now believe is that we too easily forget that our language about God is <em>always</em> metaphorical. All that humans can say is what we think God is <em>like</em>, not what God for a fact <em>is</em>. It is <em>our</em> concept of God that we talk about. But we have the habit of saying simply, “God is this or God is that.” I will share today about the evolution of my thinking about God—and it seems more authentic to use the kind of language about God that I have used in the past. But I recognize that all I say here is metaphorical, even if I don’t use qualifiers such as “God is like…”.</p>
<p>I was stimulated to reflect on how my thinking about God has changed when I heard the sermon here on God by Paul Britner in October. Paul made me ask, What do I think about God? As a starting point, I think most people actually agree that God does not <em>usually</em> directly intervene in the affairs of human beings. Even most pious Christians have experienced enough tragedy to know that God simply does not step in and stop bad things from happening. My buddy Rod getting killed in a car wreck at age 17. My dad dying suddenly of a brain aneurism at age 67. My mom’s sister having a fatal appendicitis attack when she was four. Not to mention wars, famines, pestilences. So, the question, then, is: Why? Why does God allow so much terrible stuff to happen?</p>
<p>Let me summarize one common notion: the idea is that God has a plan for the world and its inhabitants. But God keeps God’s own counsel. We can’t know what this plan is since God’s ways are not our ways. God does intervene when it suits God’s purposes and our job is to trust God and rest in the confidence that God works all things together for good—even when in the moment we can’t see how. So, God doesn’t intervene because God chooses not to, for God’s own unknowable purposes.<span id="more-6576"></span></p>
<p><span id="more-6557"></span>I realize now that I never found this notion satisfactory, though I tried to believe it for a long time. But mainly I repressed my questions and doubts. When I was in college in the mid-1970s at the University of Oregon, I took a philosophy of religion class that forced me to face those questions and doubts (though just for awhile). We read a novel by Peter De Vries, <em>The Blood of the Lamb,</em> that focused the issue of God and evil. The storyteller, based on the author himself, tries to come to terms with the illness and death of his young daughter. He had grown up in a Calvinist family where God’s all-powerfulness was the central belief. That “embedded theology,” instilled in him from the time of his birth, turned out to be utterly inadequate for helping him with this worst imaginable tragedy.</p>
<p>In my memory, the class’s teacher, Professor Zweig got pretty emotional as he agonized over the issues the book raised. I had no answers myself, I was troubled, but in my fearfulness I wrote off Professor Zweig as a skeptic who mainly wanted to undermine the faith of his Christian students. So I didn’t take him seriously. What I learned only much later was that he was born in Germany in 1930 to Jewish parents. His family barely managed to escape the Nazis in 1936 and move to the US. The issue of God’s presence in a world full of evil was indeed one that he had quite authentically agonized over his whole life.</p>
<p>However, I simply wasn’t ready to face those questions back then. What I was doing when I was in college mainly was going along with what I was being told about God, which meant I was okay with accepting theology that did not conform to my experience (or my reasoning). That is, I lived in an intellectual and spiritual fog. I simply put the questions on the back burner once the philosophy of religion class was over.</p>
<p>In the years to come, I did move away from the belief in God’s control over things. But I didn’t really think carefully about it. Maybe I didn’t actually think God was in control, but I acted as if I did. I realize now that this was a kind of “mystification.” I operated as if reality corresponds with the standard belief about God’s power. At the same time, I suspected that reality actually <em>doesn’t</em> correspond. So, I avoided thinking about it. Mystification is when there is a big gap between what I act like I believe and what I actually believe (or don’t believe). I now think that mystification is part of the view of God that many believers have. Deep down, many of us fear that our belief in an interventionist God is not actually true; but we’ve been afraid to say that.</p>
<p>It makes sense that I would avoid the difficulties with belief in an interventionist God in a world with so much brokenness. On the one hand, I sensed that if God were indeed all powerful, God must be a moral monster—at best <em>unwilling</em> to stop the wars, famines, epidemics, the success of selfish, greedy people so common in history, or, at the worst, actually <em>supporting</em> those terrible things to further God’s own purposes. But on the other hand, it terrified me to think that in this difficult world I didn’t have assurance that someone is in charge who will make things right. It made me anxious to feel at the mercy of uncontrolled violence and chaos.</p>
<p>This was a huge problem—my most important belief, about God being an interventionist God, flew in the face of reality as I experienced it. For the twenty years after my philosophy of religion class I avoided thinking carefully about the challenges that class posed. Part of the reason, I am sure, is that for much of that time I was a Mennonite pastor. To take these challenges seriously is not the best recipe for job security in the Mennonite world. To do so would inevitably involve profoundly questioning people’s comfortable assumptions about God’s power.</p>
<p>When I came to teach at EMU in 1996, right away I taught Philosophy of Religion. I wanted to use DeVries’s book and finally pay more attention to the problem of evil. Alas, the book was out of print and not available. So I chose <em>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</em> by Rabbi Harold Kushner. Like De Vries, Kushner addressed the big questions while responding to the tragic death of his young son. But whereas De Vries’s book was mainly about despair, Kushner offered a more hopeful spin.</p>
<p>Kushner presents an argument I have found helpful. He sets up a logical puzzle. Believers tend to have three convictions: (1) God is good and loving, (2) evil is real and destructive, and (3) God is all-powerful. But all three cannot be true at the same time. At most we can affirm two of the three. Kushner suggests that we simply cannot deny #2—evil is real (witness the death of his son—plus the Holocaust and so many other great evils). So, our choice is between #1 and #3. Either God is all-powerful and in control <em>or </em>God is good and loving. If God is all-powerful (and evil is real), God is complicit with evil and not good and loving. If God is good and loving (and evil is real), God can’t be all-powerful.  Kushner <em>knows</em> that God <em>is</em> loving and good and he sees no evidence that God is all-powerful and in control. I became convinced that Kushner is right.</p>
<p>I came to recognize that the idea that God is all-powerful and in control is one of the most problematic and ultimately destructive of Christian beliefs. I think this is what I always sensed, even if I didn’t have the clarity of mind or the courage overtly to accept that for a long time. The big hurdle for me when I accepted that faith in a God of love requires us to give up on an interventionist God was: What about the Bible? Doesn’t it teach that God is intervening?</p>
<p>I had to struggle with this question for a while. My way through it was to decide we should read the Bible as ancient literature, as telling stories, as not making a lot of metaphysical assumptions. We should <em>not</em> read the Bible in the way I was taught—through the lenses of Augustine and medieval Christendom and John Calvin—that <em>starts</em> with an all-powerful, never changing, transcendent God.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest the term “materialistic” for this reading strategy. To read the Bible “materialistically,” we read it without assuming that “miracles” and God’s direct intervention are historical. It’s a <em>story</em> that is told in the same world that we live in. Thus, we assume that if something doesn’t happen in <em>our</em> world (such as seas being parted and thousands of soldiers being drowned when the waters crash back down), then it didn’t happen in the past. When the Bible tells about such an event, the Bible tells a story, a kind of “holy fiction” that conveys truths but does not describe actual events. Reading the Bible materialistically helps us find in the Bible a picture of God that actually does fit with life as we know it—a God of mercy who does not intervene to stop bad things from happening but who suffers with the suffering and witnesses to the path of love. This certainly isn’t the only picture of God in the Bible, but I believe that God as love is where the Bible as a whole leads us.</p>
<p>So, the reason that God does not intervene is because God is love. It’s not that God could intervene but chooses not to; it’s that love simply is not interventionist and controlling. The power of God is the power of empathy, the power of mercy, the power of connection. God also suffers when children get sick and die. God can’t stop such events, but God empowers love, the kind of “intervention” children most need.</p>
<p>God’s is the power that moves people to give their lives for their friends, that energizes resistance to evil, that brings life back in face of brokenness. It’s like the singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn affirms in his song “Where the Death Squad Lives.” In the midst of crying out against the violence of Latin American militarists against people who resist, Cockburn affirms, “around every evil there gathers love, bombs aren’t the only things that fall from above.”</p>
<p>The writer Rebecca Solnit addresses this dynamic in her terrific book, <em>A Paradise Built in Hell</em>. She does not name the paradise-building power “God,” but I think she could. She writes about various massive disasters such as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1917 Halifax explosion, 9/11 in New York, and Hurricane Katrina. She discovered what I would call the presence of God in the midst of these terrible events—not in preventing them but in working within them through human love that unexpectedly created powerful communities of healing.</p>
<p>If I were to teach Philosophy of Religion now, I would use a book, <em>The Female Face of God in Auschwitz</em> by Jewish theologian Melissa Raphael. In moving detail, she recounts stories of women caring for other women in the Nazi death camps. She argues against the common belief that God was absent during the Holocaust. God was indeed present, right in the midst of the suffering, when people loved one another. These caring relationships invited God’s presence into that place on earth that seemed most godless.</p>
<p>Now, a God who is simply love and cannot intervene with controlling power may, to many, <em>not</em> seem like God. I think that’s fine. I’m more concerned to affirm love than to affirm the metaphor “God.” I can’t say “God exists” as a fact. But I can say that “love exists.” I not only believe love exists, I have seen it. Now, love is fragile. It can be stifled. It’s not interventionist. I think what most matters is this: How do we cultivate love? Still, I believe that linking love with God is a way to say that love is what matters most. It’s a way to affirm the universal character of love. It’s a way to recognize that all of life is sacred, that every human being and every other living creature deserves respect and care. For me, to say God is love is a way to assert that war and the death penalty and any other kind of lethal violence toward any human being is wrong, blasphemy in fact.</p>
<p>Let me close with another Bruce Cockburn line: “If you love love, then love loves you too.” Amen.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Mark Douglas, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Pacifism-Environmental-Mark-Douglas/dp/1108476481/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mark+douglas+christian+pacifism&amp;qid=1593791138&amp;sr=8-1">Christian Pacifism for an Environmental Age</a> </em>(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2019) viii + 269pp.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ted Grimsrud—July 3, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Mark Douglas, Professor of Christian Ethics at Columbia Theological Seminary, has written an interesting book that addresses important issues. Most of the book focuses on Christian pacifism and its history, offering a highly critical analysis of how Christian pacifists have presented their tradition. Douglas suggests that the climate crisis provides a challenging context for reconsidering Christian pacifism.</p>
<p>Douglas summarizes “the conventional narrative” of the history of Christian pacifism. It begins with Jesus, the New Testament and early Christians until Constantine as universally pacifist. This all changed with the first Christian emperor who oversaw the aligning of the church with imperial power and signaled the end of pacifism as a core Christian conviction. A just war ethic, especially as articulated by Augustine, replaced pacifism and “constitutes not only a change but a fall away from fidelity to a Jesus-centered ethics” (p. 3).</p>
<p>In much of the book that follows, Douglas uses this summary as a foil for a sharp critique of the narrative of Christian pacifism by recent pacifists (he actually only picks up, briefly near the end of the book, the theme of our current environmental crisis; the book’s title is thus misleading). He portrays the Christian pacifist narrative as being centered on that problematic construal of early Christianity—what he calls, disparagingly, the “myth of return” (pp. 7-10) where pacifists seek to recover the supposed purity of the early Christians.<span id="more-6568"></span></p>
<p>Douglas sees the “conventional narrative” being strongly shaped by a series of writers he labels “the great historians of Christian pacifism” (p. 56)—namely, C.J. Cadoux, Guy F. Hershberger, Roland Bainton, and Jean-Michel Hornus. These historians, Douglas argues, <em>misunderstood</em> the dynamics around war refusal in early Christianity, the nature of the influence of Constantine, the stance of the church toward war and peace in the period between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries, and how best to apply Jesus’s message about love to the present world.</p>
<p>Douglas continues his examination of Christian pacifism by considering the thought and actions of three influential 20<sup>th</sup> century figures: John Howard Yoder, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Dorothy Day. He focuses on these three because they helpfully addressed many of what Douglas as problems with “the conventional narrative” of the Christian pacifist tradition. Yet, he argues that their “complex theological visions of pacifism and their significant arguments in its defense nevertheless manifest new expressions of the very problems they attempt to escape” (p. 160).</p>
<p>Douglas, thus, presents Christian pacifism as problematic. He seems to recommend a mostly pragmatic approach, not seeking “to get pacifism right” as to “use [the various] pacifisms better” (p. 180), drawing on their insights but not being preoccupied with purity or perfection.</p>
<p>The third and final section of the book, “Re-Narrating the History of the Church and Nonviolence,” develops Douglas’s theological agenda. Pacifism actually turns out to be fairly marginal to this agenda. Douglas uses pacifism as a foil to advance a theological agenda that sees pacifism as at best a helpful, though profoundly limited, subtheme.</p>
<p>His critique of pacifism, ultimately, leaves a lot to be desired. He never gives us a clear and concise definition of “pacifism.” That vagueness makes it difficult to track his critique as the book moves along. His use of the notion of the Christian pacifist tradition’s “myth of return” exaggerates the role that that “myth” plays in the tradition. Certainly, Christian pacifists have referred to Jesus and the early church as key inspirations for their convictions. However, I would argue that pacifism has arisen mainly as a response to particular contexts where warfare was making demands on Christians not so much as a coherent consistent appeal to some authoritative original pacifism.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for Douglas’s emphasis on the “myth of return” is his reliance on “the great historians of Christian pacifism” (p. 56) for his construal of that tradition. However, these were neither “great historians” nor especially influential among Christian pacifists. C.J. Cadoux was a relatively obscure British theologian whose book <em>The Early Christian Attitude Toward War </em>was published in 1918 and was virtually unknown in the United States. Guy Hershberger was a Mennonite college professor and by training a historian of the United States. His 1944 book, <em>War, Peace, and Nonresistance</em> was important for Mennonites but was virtually unknown beyond Mennonite circles. Jean-Michel Hornus was a pastor in the French Reformed Church with a doctorate in theology. His book, <em>It is not Lawful for Me to Fight</em>, was first published in French in 1960 and was not published in English until 1980. Those who know of this book esteem it, but it was never widely circulated. Finally, Roland Bainton was a professor of history at Yale Divinity School and his book, <em>Christian Attitudes Toward War and Peace</em> (also published in 1960), has been well known and influential. However, it is very much a popular-level survey, not a deeply researched scholarly study.</p>
<p>Douglas’s critique of these four books does seem mostly accurate. However, that they are mostly obscure, popular level, and by now old writings actually undermines his case that they reflect the centrality of the (problematic) focus on early Christians as central for defining Christian pacifism.</p>
<p>Douglas’s failure to offer a clear definition of pacifism links with his tendency throughout the book to treat pacifism mainly as a set of vague ideas. He does not have much to say about actual manifestations of Christian pacifism in history. Ultimately, this is more a book of abstract theologizing focusing on Christian doctrines (note especially chapter 7, “Time and Tradition in a Theological Framework”) than either a critical engagement with an embodied tradition of thought and action or an attempt to draw from the Christian pacifist tradition actual guidance for engaging our current environmental crises.</p>
<p>In conclusion, because it does discuss important issues, I can recommend that readers interested in those issues give <em>Christian Pacifism for an Environmental Age</em> a look. But overall it is a pretty disappointing effort.</p>

<p>I wrote “Yellow Insomnia” during my own relapse of sleeplessness shortly after the murder of George Floyd. Written for two voices, the poem meditates on shared suffering and shared mission, particularly through the lens of Asian and Black solidarity. While writing, I kept hearing poet <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/randall-horton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randall Horton&#8217;s</a> voice in my head. His friendship and mentorship always meant a great deal to me, and I&#8217;m honored to collaborate with him on this audio poem as an act of allyship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While mixing the audio, I sought to &#8220;braid&#8221; our voices with the sound of fire, which invokes both collective ritual and the intimacy of the fireside, to create an immersive memoriam that kindles a sense of rebirth. </span></p>

In other words, a transformation within our own lives is important.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Yellow Insomnia</b><br />
by Monica Ong</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All sentient beings have at one time been your mother. —</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhist proverb</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellow insomnia is the hiss of midnight over another city in flames, a white knee on the black throat of a father shattered, who was, in another life, my father, your father, your father’s father, this heart (of our country) ground into the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our shared hurt a constant waking. It is the inability to zoom out and distinguish the wound from the body, the body from the wound. Yellow insomnia is the knowing of being watched by eyes that never learned to see us whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking in skin singed by a weak man’s projection of peril. His monsters and mistresses take on the shape of your face, the movement of your hands, your body a shadow beneath this hallucination of America, slowly dying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to unmake this deadly gaze? When will our love for you be sharp enough to sever the roots of the venomous vine? What is this life if not to honor yours, your daughter’s, your daughter’s daughter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the drowse of grief, the night brain swells with uncontrolled blossoms of milk thistle and tansy, my troubled questions dotted with their sprawling lace border of blooming yarrow. The way a broken branch when touching soil manages to press its young green fingers into a new hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years before aunt Juanita died, I remember her examining me in grandmother’s temple from her metal chair, her eyes searching me in prophecy. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two demon daughters standing inside you, one at each shoulder</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is a door that refuses to close. The black tiger and the golden lion are terrifying or majestic depending on one’s faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♦</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notes: In Nichiren Buddhism, the demon daughters appear in the “Dharani” (26th) chapter of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lotus Sutra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as protectors who have taken a vow to shield and guard the dignity of human life. Audio poem read by poets Randall Horton and Monica Ong, mixed and edited by Monica Ong. </span></p>

  <p>Jarmel Reitz is a Philly-based artist, font of sunshine and rainbows, and convicted felon. Here she tells the intimate story of her arrest over 16 pounds of cannabis and her subsequent experiences in jail, where she received a radicalizing education in systemic dehumanization and white privilege. This conversation was originally recorded and briefly released in 2018 before we took it offline. Today, on what would have been her release date from prison if not for a plea bargain extended because of her whiteness, Jarmel decided it was time to make this conversation public. It is more prescient than ever as we collectively grapple with deep inequity and systemic violence against people of color and those without resources. From her teen years experimenting with drugs in Jersey through incarceration in Chicago, Jarmel radiates a fundamental devotion to radical acceptance and self expression that is infectious and liberating.

  <p><span class=" wf_caption" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; float: right; max-width: 350px; width: 100%; display: block;"><span style="text-align: left; color: #333333; display: block;">Bruce Schenk (right), along with IIRP President John Bailie at the IIRP Canada Conference in Toronto, 2018.</span></span>It is with a great sense of warmth and gratitude that we say farewell to Bruce Schenk, who is retiring as Director of IIRP Canada after serving for 12 years. Bruce’s pioneering work in Canada has been instrumental in extending the ability of individuals and organizations to foster healthy, meaningful relationships in schools, justice systems, workplaces and other areas of society.</p>
<p>“When I started in 2008, restorative justice was a known thing in criminal and juvenile justice circles in Canada, and a little bit in schools, but not restorative practices,” says Bruce. “The thing I’m feeling really good about is how restorative practice is now seen as applicable to so many areas, especially education, and IIRP Canada has had a big role in that.”</p>
<p>“Bruce has been a transformative leader in the field,” observes IIRP President John Bailie, Ph.D. “He has helped expand restorative practices from a set of skills to a way of approaching life and relationships in general.”</p>
<p>Bruce explains, “I think the key thing here is restorative practice being seen as a framework, a way of thinking and a way of acting rather than simply a range of practices. Unless you change the thinking of the system, new practices won’t take hold.”</p>
<p>He adds, “I’m really honored to have worked with the IIRP in this role, and very lucky to work with such a great organization. I am extremely grateful to all the mentorship and support Terry O’Connell and IIRP Founder Ted Wachtel gave me, especially in the early days, and the overall support the organization has given IIRP Canada and me over the years to develop restorative practices in a way that fits the Canadian context.”</p>
<p>Pat Lewis, who comes with nearly three decades of experience as a teacher and school administrator with Peel District School Board and teacher trainer for Brock University and the Ontario Principals' Council (OPC), will now assume the role of Director of IIRP Canada. Her involvement with school, School Board and Provincial-led initiatives provided opportunities for her to lead and monitor large-scale change initiatives. This experience will serve IIRP Canada’s growth in the years to come. Pat became Associate Director of IIRP Canada in 2019 to facilitate a year of transition.</p>
<p>“I look forward to building on the strong foundation that Bruce established,” says Pat. “During this transition year, I have met incredible practitioners doing amazing work across Canada. I am excited about the opportunity to support their ongoing restorative work. Through conversations with many stakeholders, I am also aware that there is much more work to do, and I am committed to facilitating meaningful dialogue about the future of restorative practices in our schools, our communities and in our public and private organizations.”</p>
<p><span class=" wf_caption" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; float: right; max-width: 230px; width: 100%; display: block;"><span style="text-align: left; color: #333333; display: block;">New IIRP Canada Director Pat Lewis</span></span>At Peel District School Board, the second largest school district in Ontario, Pat initiated and supported the implementation of restorative practices, which is now included in district-wide Safe Schools policy, in dozens of schools. Pat has volunteered as a facilitator on local Community Youth Justice Committees and worked closely with community organizations serving at-risk youth. She holds a Master of Education in Leadership and Administration.</p>
<p>“As an educator, my interest was in nurturing staff leadership to promote a culture and climate change within schools that would support the social, emotional and learning needs of all students,” says Pat. “I want to bring that same sense to working in a collaborative way with our clients to support ongoing change and implementation of restorative practices.”</p>
<p>“We are excited and pleased to welcome Pat,” says John. “She brings a wealth of experience in restorative practices, both as an educator and a senior organizational leader. Her vision, collaborative spirit and team-based approach will be a transformative force in the Canadian context.”</p>
<p>Of Pat and her colleagues who will continue his work, Bruce comments, “I feel really good about the team that has been assembled for IIRP Canada heading into the future!”</p>
<p>John concludes, “Though Bruce is leaving his role as Director of IIRP Canada, we are very pleased that he will continue to explore the intersection of restorative practices with other aspects of life, particularly faith communities, where he has been so influential.”</p>
<p>Bruce will be missed, but we trust he will continue to have a voice in the development of the field.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; font-family: Georgia;">A</span>t a time of pandemic and civil unrest, many of us are glued to our devices, doomscrolling with anticipation for the worst to come. We rely on technology more than ever before to connect to each other, our students, our families. How do we use it wisely? And how do we manage and protect our attention when our lifeline to the outside world is designed to exploit it?</p>
<p>In this webinar, we will take a look at the market forces that incentivize technology to distract and manipulate us. We’ll consider the consequences of chronic distraction in the short and long term, across individuals and society as a whole. And then we’ll look to attention restoration theory (ART) for ideas about what to do differently.</p>
<p>ART is a theory that helps us understand how our attention is depleted and restored. At UW, I used ART in an undergraduate design methods course to frame the design of restorative spaces and experiences on the University of Washington’s campus. In the process, students showed promising signs of changing their behaviors and attitudes with technology. We’ll learn about several of the practices we used in the class, many of which were contemplative in nature. We’ll also consider how these practices, and a design-framing, might help us and our students use technology differently.</p>

She researches how public space and technology can be designed to restore attention and facilitate contemplative experience. Through her work, she hopes to help us develop skills and a greater capacity for accessing personal wisdom; connecting with others through compassion and friendship, improving the quality of our lives through awareness of life as we’re living it, and mitigating or minimizing the harms of attention-driven digital culture. Beck was formally trained as a designer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and spent her career before returning to academia helping museums, libraries, and nonprofits embrace risk-taking, creativity, and change through technology and personal space-making. Her work from that time was mentioned in <em>the New York Times, National Public Radio, Scientific American</em>, and several books and blogs.</p>

The teenage girls meditate, practice archer<span style="font-weight: 400;">y, and contemplatively arrange flowers. But for the runaway-protagonist, Olivia, and her friends, their focus that summer is learning to levitate, and the dreamy 20-something gardener they think can teach them. This training in the supernatural, however, is advanced, and their pursuit leads them down a dangerous and complex path in this coming-of-age story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With references to “inherent goodness,” abusive teachers, and unreliable authorities, it’s hard not to think of Shambhala Buddhism and the revelations of the past few years that have led its leader, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, stepping down. Temple grew up practicing in the Shambhala community, and her experience shapes </span><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062905321/the-lightness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lightness</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published by HarperCollins in June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following interview, Tricycle talks with Temple, who also is an editor living in Brooklyn, and Maya Rook, a historian and former member of Shambhala. They discuss the new book as well as growing up in the tradition and spending their summers at the Karme Choling retreat center in rural Vermont, where their parents received teachings from Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist teacher. </span></p>
<p><b>I was doing a good amount of reporting two years ago when </b><a href="https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shambhala-abuse/"><b>Project Sunshine started releasing reports</b></a><b> on abuse in Shambhala. It was hard to not think about the abuse and power dynamics while reading </b><b><i>The Lightness</i></b><b>. And at the time, we didn’t hear a whole lot from women in Shambhala—we heard from teachers and lawyers and spokespeople. I realize your book is fiction, but it’s also a great opportunity to talk about abuses of power from a woman’s perspective and how this book fits into the time that we’re living in. </b></p>
<p><b>Emily Temple (ET): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started writing it before any of the reports of the Sakyong&#8217;s abuse and misconduct came out, but as has become more and more clear to me in my life, this has been a part of the Shambhala community as well as almost every community in which there&#8217;s a hierarchy and men are in power. I remember as a kid thinking that Buddhism in general, and Shambhala in particular, was better than other religions and systems. Part of the writing of this book was dealing with the fact that I&#8217;m finding this not to be true. I still think Shambhala is “more right” than other systems, especially on a metaphysical level. But I was very disappointed to realize that these same hierarchies and abuses of power were happening in this world that I loved so much and felt so safe in as a child.</span></p>
<p><b>I didn&#8217;t mean to start with such a hardball. Oops.</b></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just jump right in.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you both tell me how you know each other? That’s an easy question to start with. </b></p>
<p><b>Maya</b> <b>Rook</b> <b>(MR):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We know each other from growing up in Shambhala. Our parents attended the same retreat program every summer with </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/path-faith-and-path-reasoning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I don&#8217;t remember exactly when you started coming to the program, Emily—I started going in ’92 or so. </span></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I also can&#8217;t quite remember. It seems that my parents went from basically the time I was born until I was a senior in high school. There were a lot of kids around our age and they set up a makeshift camp for us next to the lake. I remember it being this perfect, idyllic, fun experience that I could not explain to any of my friends at home. </span></p>
<p><b>MR:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;ve never felt represented in a book. It&#8217;s fiction, but there are certain elements from my childhood that just don&#8217;t show up in fiction. And so it was really incredible for me to see little pieces taken from some of the things we did at Karme Choling [a Shambhala retreat center in Barnet, Vermont] and also a capturing of the magic of that place.</span></p>
<p><b>ET</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I&#8217;m glad I captured the magic. But it really does feel like magic to me—it’s still one of my favorite places in the world. </span></p>
<p><b>Maya, what are some of those little pieces? </b></p>
<p><b>MR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t thought about the electric fence in a while. It was a very low-level electric fence, and sometimes for fun the kids would touch it and get a little shock, or hold a piece of grass to it. And that they divided people into tiger, lion, garuda, and dragon groups. We were given a lot of freedom during those summers and trusted to do our own thing. We had people who were watching us and guiding activities and things like that, but for a lot of those summers I remember running around in the woods and having that freedom. </span></p>

<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it wasn’t organized like a family camp. I remember having meditation instruction in the mornings in a tent, and there was one summer when we did a coming-of-age ceremony where we went into the woods, made a bow with our Swiss Army knife and shot an arrow. </span></p>
<p><b>MR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Places like Boulder, Colorado, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, had a lot of us Dharma Brats [a nickname for American Buddhist children] there, but I grew up in the Albany area. I didn’t have any friends at home who understood. In some ways, there was something about it that made me feel really special, and in other ways made me feel very different from other people.</span></p>
<p><b>ET</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I felt exactly the same. My friends all called it “Buddhist Camp” because the closest analogy they had was the Jewish Community Center. The Syracuse Shambhala Center is my dad&#8217;s garage. It’s a very limited community. And yeah, the same feeling of both difference and real specialness that we had access to something that seemed bigger, enchanting, and separate. </span></p>
<p><b>And your parents were there for a meditation retreat? What were they doing exactly? </b></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My understanding of it is that [Tibetan teacher] Khenpo Rinpoche was continuing [Shambhala founder] </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/encounter-shadow-buddhist-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chögyam Trungpa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s teachings for advanced students. We must have been allowed into some of the evening talks, because I have memories of him on his throne. </span></p>

<p><b><i>The Lightness </i></b><b>is set in a summer camp. Did your own experience at Karme Choling set the scene?</b></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to distance myself from my actual experience, because nothing happened to me during those summers except that I had a great time. I know that mindfulness techniques and meditation are used to help teenagers in situations where they are acting out, so I turned the camp into a place you might go if you got into too much trouble. </span></p>
<p><b>Your parents are a part of Shambhala. Do you have your own practice? </b></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did Shambhala training on my own when I was in college. I just never found the right group and I gave up on the notion of community and continued my own practice. Part of it was that I was always the youngest person there—everyone would pat me on the head like I was this oddity. Maya, I know you went pretty far. </span></p>
<p><b>MR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I went into the center of the mandala. </span></p>
<p><b>ET</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: All the way.</span></p>
<p><b>MR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I started Shambhala training when I was 12. I found this profound meditation practice that was helpful for me navigating middle school and the complexities of that. By the time I finished college I had finished most of Shambhala training and the Sacred Path [higher levels of training beyond basic meditation]. And then I stepped back for a very long time—I just wasn’t ready to take the next step. I came back for the meditation practice and did another </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dathun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [month-long meditation retreat]. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started going very deep after that. I worked at the meditation center in New York City from 2013 to 2016. It was a crisis—we couldn’t afford the rent and everybody stepped down from their positions. We did a lot to try to save the center, but ultimately I feel that we got pushed out. </span></p>
<p><b>What happened next? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MR:</strong> I had accepted a job working in the Sakyong’s home as a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">jusung</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means “lineage protector.” I was essentially a nanny, and that was one of the most incredible experiences of my life and also ultimately one of the most devastating, because I saw all those power dynamics and patterns of abuse that really came to light during </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/shambhala-leaders-resign/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Sunshine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [an initiative that exposed patterns of abuse in the Shambhala community]. I never witnessed any [abuse] when I worked for the Sakyong, but I don’t doubt any of those stories because there was something not right at the center of the mandala. </span></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a lot. At the beginning of our conversation I said, “Oh, this is how it works in all hierarchical systems where men have power.” But I do wonder whether there&#8217;s something wrong at the core of Shambhala. One of the things that I find pretty disheartening is that I can’t imagine being a young person who comes to Shambhala now, seeing what the system is. Right now, because the Sakyong is the only empowered guru in the organization, it’s his bat and ball—you have to play his game or you can’t play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think, Maya? Is there a specific issue with Shambhala itself or is it more that any time a person is venerated, there’s going to be some space for abuse? </span></p>
<p><b>MR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I think there&#8217;s something specific to Shambhala, but it is also, as you mentioned, an issue of any hierarchical system. In terms of religious communities, Shambhala is a smaller community and things can get really, really amplified. People are working intensely with their minds and it&#8217;s bringing up their karma, past, and emotions. And when you’re working with people coming from different cultures, it can add a lot of complexities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if that makes sense. There is so much I’m still processing. </span></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it makes perfect sense. We are adapting traditions from an entirely different culture and a really old system—it makes sense that it would be a little creaky for us. </span></p>
<p><b>MR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we have a diversity of people and religions, America was founded as a Christian nation, with Christianity’s belief in original sin, that there’s something wrong with you. And Shambhala is about a foundation of basic goodness. My understanding of meditation is to wake up to reality and to our true nature. And a lot of times, people get into meditation because they want to feel a different way. </span></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shambhala obviously isn’t the only kind of Buddhism, but I do think it has value, because it was created for Westerners. But I don&#8217;t know what the way to move forward is. Maya, you probably know better than me.</span></p>
<p><b>MR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: One of the ways for me to move forward was actually leaving the community. It made me feel like my whole world was falling apart, but I had to trust myself to be able to continue to embody the teachings. If we’re living the teachings, we are passing them on in a way. </span></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At least that&#8217;s a hopeful take. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_53693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53693" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-53693" src="https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/emily-temple-462x625.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="625" srcset="https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/emily-temple-462x625.jpg 462w, https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/emily-temple-757x1024.jpg 757w, https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/emily-temple-591x800.jpg 591w, https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/emily-temple-832x1125.jpg 832w, https://tricycle.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/emily-temple.jpg 961w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53693" class="wp-caption-text">Emily Temple, author of <i>The Lightness</i></figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Going back to the book, the group of girls persuade Luke, the gardener, to teach them how to levitate. They’ve heard that it can be done, and also that it can be dangerous without a teacher. But ultimately, having a “teacher” ends very badly. Similarly, in Shambhala, teachers and other people in positions of power have caused a lot of harm. </b></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depending on how you interpret the ending—and I have decided not to interpret the ending for people—it can be read as putting a lie to the fact that you need a teacher and you can’t find it for yourself. Both ways are possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Buddhists, we’re not supposed to be learning to levitate at all. I think of the story of the acolyte who learned to float across the river and the Buddha says, &#8220;Why did you spend years doing that? You could have just paid the ferryman a penny.&#8221; But we&#8217;re talking about teenagers. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Cool. Levitation.&#8221; Luke is this stand-in for the figure that you imbue with special power from a distance. He is alluring in many ways—he has attained some kind of spiritual level that they covet, and he&#8217;s very attractive and sexy. It’s that charismatic leader thing on a much lower level. I didn’t want an advanced teacher to be the person that was venerated in this book, because I wanted to show that you can be the absolute leader of the community or you can be the guy that works in the garden. Unfortunately. </span></p>
<p><b>MR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For me, Luke was such a conglomeration of different men I experienced in Shambhala. Sometimes there’s flirtation, a touching of the arm, or a “smell the freshness of this tomato,” which happened to me in the garden—I was about 15 years old and someone was about six years older than me. I don’t know if you experienced this, Emily, but if there were a bunch of girls around, men would say, “Oh, look at these </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dakinis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” [a fierce feminine force in Tibetan Buddhism].</span></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><b>MR: “</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, you’re such a little daikini.” This term would make you feel distanced from them, and in some ways they were holding you up but ultimately that language put men at a higher level. I saw those elements coming together in Luke. </span></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s othering—if you’re a mystical being that means you’re not fully a person. The central question for me while writing this book was how much power you have as a teenage girl and as a woman. We often take power away from young women because we think that they don’t know what they’re doing. The reason I chose that age, 16, is that you’re not really a child or an adult. It’s this transitional moment when you have some of both, and you’re just realizing what your power is and can be or isn’t.  </span></p>

<p><b>What do you want future Shambhala practitioners to remember about the last few years? </b></p>
<p><b>MR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that as challenging and as difficult as this time is, it&#8217;s also a very liberating time and an opportunity for change to happen. Some of the old stories that were pushed down for so long have been forced into the light. While I have disengaged from the community, I do appreciate the people who have decided to remain and are committed to making changes. </span></p>
<p><b>ET:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We’ve also seen examples of personal strength and bravery—just that this was brought to light at all, particularly given the </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/how-samaya-works/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">samaya</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vows [a commitment between a student and their teacher] in place, because people had to step over the line that they were told was not to be stepped over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope they can</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">continue shining light on things with this sense of bravery. Because I think what&#8217;s at the core of the teachings is very valuable, and we should still share that with people despite the human failings that surround the delivery.</span></p>
<p><b>MR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: People sharing their stories and taking action is also in line with that bravery. One of my good friends was molested by someone in the community when she was 13, and it wasn’t dealt with through legal authorities—they didn’t go to the police, and he was not supposed to go near her or attend any of the programs she was at. I think she went to therapy…it was pushed down. When all this came out, I made a public post on Facebook saying that I had already left and was there if anyone needed to talk. She had no idea all these other stories had come out, and she called me and she said that for her whole life, she felt like she was the only person that this happened to. We lost touch again after that, but I saw that she pressed charges, and another victim came forward as well, and he has been sentenced. That is one of the bravest things I saw coming out of this on a personal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think this is a time of people reevaluating their relationship with their teacher. Just because you’ve taken a vow doesn’t mean you have to stay silent if you see a failure of leadership that&#8217;s harming people. But unfortunately, what I&#8217;ve seen in the Sakyong during this whole time is a vanishing act. He never really apologized for what happened in his letters to the community. [Now there is] is an opportunity for the Sakyong to step up and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry and I want to make this right,&#8221; and I just don&#8217;t see that that has happened.</span></p>
<p><b>ET: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [This time of reevaluation] definitely creates a space for, just as you say, other kinds of leadership. I would love to see more women and people of color in leadership positions. I think that is an obvious step, because it&#8217;s just such a monolithic thing right now. And Shambhala is acting as though the scandal is over and things are going back to normal. I would like to be able to look back [on this moment] and say that we didn’t let that happen, that we didn&#8217;t, as a community, let things go back to </span><a href="https://shambhalatimes.org/2020/01/16/letter-from-ani-pema-chodron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business as usual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we&#8217;ll see.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ted Grimsrud—June 29, 2020</strong></p>
<p>People in this country have greatly differing deep-seated views of the very meaning of the story of the US. I suspect these differences make achieving healing amidst our current crises extremely difficult. This is true especially as related to what the great thinker W.E.B. DuBois in 1900 looked ahead foresightedly to call <em>the</em> problem of the 20<sup>th</sup> century—<em>the problem of the color line</em> (from<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Souls-Black-Folk-Oxford-dp-0199957967/dp/0199957967/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1593438417"> <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em></a>). This problem clearly remains one of the main problems of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and it affects all our other crises.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Two versions of the story of the United States</strong></p>
<p>Let me suggest that, even with all our diversity, we think of two main general perspectives on the United States story that are held by those who oppose racism and see the legacy of slavery in this country as a bad thing. The first perspective sees the United States as foundationally and systemically racist from the beginning down to our present day in spite of scattered attempts to move toward freedom for all. The second perspective sees the United States ultimately as a nation of freedom and justice, in spite of scattered missteps along the way. (I recognize that there are some in the nation who are not all that negative about either racism or slavery; my concern here is with people who would say racism and slavery are bad.)</p>
<p>The term “racism” is complicated—and later in this essay I will probably make it even more complicated. For now, I want to use “racism” in the sense defined by Ibram X. Kendi in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stamped-Beginning-Definitive-History-National/dp/1568585985/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1422QWH1N0V8R&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=stamped+from+the+beginning+by+ibram+x.+kendi&amp;qid=1593438546&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=stamped%2Cstripbooks%2C135&amp;sr=1-2"><em>Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America</em></a>: “My definition of a racist idea is a simple one: it is any concept that regards one racial group as inferior or superior to another racial group in any way. I define anti-Black racist ideas as any idea suggesting that Black people, or any group of Black people, are inferior in any way to another racial group” (p. 5).</p>
<p>My thoughts about these two perspectives were helped by a recent essay by Masha Gessen, “Why are some journalists afraid of ‘moral clarity’?” (on the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-are-some-journalists-afraid-of-moral-clarity?utm_source=nl&amp;utm_brand=tny&amp;utm_mailing=TNY_Daily_062520&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;bxid=5bd66d492ddf9c619437e343&amp;cndid=2420537&amp;hasha=9c52632f298c4196d59cdf2d69efd12a&amp;hashb=7f9064d659c02262d4ec2121971257ce0eaad3fc&amp;hashc=08f7c0a25af39df36bad31c51782741efb2a57233413062cdc57aed54e48ab42&amp;esrc=CO_REG_RLVIEW&amp;utm_term=TNY_Daily"><em>New Yorker</em> website, June 24, 2020</a>). Gessen interacts with commentator Andrew Sullivan. She summarizes Sullivan’s description of the first view (which he opposes) that sees the US as “systemically racist, and a white-supremacist project from the start.” In this view, “the ideals about individual liberty, religious freedom, limited government, and the equality of human beings” were always secondary to the white supremacy project. “The liberal system is itself a form of white supremacy—which is why racial inequality endures.”</p>
<p>The second view (with which Sullivan agrees) tells the story of the United States as “primarily one of a nation of immigrants, the story of a society that, over time, enfranchised an ever-greater number of its members, and where the arc of history has bent toward justice.” This view then assumes a legacy of progress even against racism, witness the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement.<span id="more-8731"></span></p>
<p>One way to illustrate the fundamental tension between these two views is in terms that Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist, used in an 1860 lecture: America is “descended from two distinct societies, one born among the Bible-inspired believers in the Magna Charta [who landed in Massachusetts] aboard the <em>Mayflower</em> in 1620, and the other aboard a ‘Dutch galley’ slave ship landing in Virginia in 1619. One society led to ‘light’ and the other ‘darkness’” (summary from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frederick-Douglass-David-W-Blight/dp/1416590323/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1593438592&amp;sr=1-3">David Blight, <em>Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom</em></a>, p. 316). The US story may be seen as a perennial tension between these two images—the big differences have to do with how we understand the dynamics of that tension. Which image has been dominant? Or has it always been a pendulum swinging between the two options?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Thinking about the Civil War</strong></p>
<p>As I have been studying the Civil War era in recent months, I can see how these two views of the US story shape how one would think of the Civil War and its legacy. The most well known and widely read of American historians of that era—such as Eric Foner, James McPherson, and James Oakes, all good liberals who clearly hate slavery and white supremacy—are quite positive about the legacy of the Civil War. Foner even wrote a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Story-American-Freedom-Norton-Paperback/dp/0393319628/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TGO26MSJZD0I&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+story+of+american+freedom+eric+foner&amp;qid=1593438649&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+story+of+americ%2Cstripbooks%2C144&amp;sr=1-1"><em>The Story of American Freedom</em></a> (Norton, 1998) that celebrates the Civil War as part of the admittedly difficult and costly struggle to widen the scope of freedom in the US—a struggle that has inexorably moved in a positive direction (we could say, in Douglass’s terms, it moved toward “Massachusetts” and away from “Virginia”).</p>
<p>I have yet to encounter a major historian who is very negative about the Civil War, but DuBois, in his great 1935 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Reconstruction-America-1860-1880-Burghardt/dp/0684856573/ref=sr_1_3?crid=35C4UL363EUIF&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=black+reconstruction+in+america+by+w.e.b.+dubois&amp;qid=1593438718&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=black+rec%2Cstripbooks%2C143&amp;sr=1-3"><em>Black Reconstruction in America</em></a>, hints at a more negative interpretation—and certainly does not affirm the positive view of US history represented by Foner’s work. Regardless of what one thinks of the Civil War itself, if one sees the US story as a story of a society that is foundationally racist, one would have to accept that the Civil War did not succeed in changing that reality.</p>
<p>My critique of the canonical historians is that I don’t think they take seriously enough the persistence of the “Virginia” version of the US story. Of course, they don’t deny the regression toward segregation and Jim Crow that followed the failure of Reconstruction in the decades after the Civil War. But I don’t think they take seriously enough the idea that the Civil War was actually a failure in overcoming the evils of white supremacy regarding which slavery was only the tip of the iceberg. Is the Civil War part of a heroic narrative about freedom and justice that characterizes the US project—or is it rather just another element in the long trajectory of systemic injustice (or, at best, a brief and failed attempt to resist that trajectory)?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Problems with the “heroic narrative”</strong></p>
<p>Gessen seems to think we are currently at an important moment in US history. The idea of the US as, all things considered, a force for freedom and justice is being publicly challenged in perhaps unprecedented ways. “Donald Trump has already dislodged the story of this country as a nation of immigrants on an inexorable path toward justice and equality, guaranteed by a commitment to individual liberties…. The reason we seem to be witnessing the emergence of a new political consensus is that the old consensus had already withered. The new story, being shaped right now, is neither dogmatic nor simplistic. It is, however, based on a different set of assumptions than the old story—and this is a good thing, and a necessary thing.”</p>
<p>In our moment of disruption, those such as Andrew Sullivan who hold stubbornly to what Gessen calls a “heroic narrative of America” actually contribute to the problem that makes “structural racism … so immovable…. Sullivan and others don’t appear to see two competing historical narratives; rather they see a challenge not to a story but to <em>the truth</em>, an eternal certainty, a natural state of things that [our current] protests are threatening to destroy.”</p>
<p>Thinking of the primacy of the “Massachusetts” vision for the US as a <em>fact</em> actually makes it impossible to recognize the persistence of white supremacy as a fundamental reality of the US project at its core. That failure makes it impossible to get to the roots of our problems. As we have seen at least since the 1860s, it appears that no amount of surface reform (even including the ending of most versions of legal slavery [remember, though, that the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment at the end of the Civil War abolished most forms of slavery but allowed for convicted criminals to continue to be treated as slaves]) actually can succeed at turning the tide in relation to our systemic, foundational racism.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Getting to the roots</strong></p>
<p>My own disillusionment with the “heroic narrative of America” goes back about 45 years to my learning about what actually had happened in the US war on Vietnam. The more I learned about the practices of the American Empire (an important early source for me was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Way-Life-Predicament-Alternative/dp/0977197239/ref=sr_1_2?crid=31MJ1PW8B8FQW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=william+appleman+williams&amp;qid=1593438761&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=william+app%2Cstripbooks%2C152&amp;sr=1-2">William Appelman Williams’s <em>Empire as a Way of Life</em></a>), the more I realized that the US is not a force for freedom and justice in the world.</p>
<p>I have been aware of the racist component to US warism. We have almost always warred against non-white people. I learned about this while writing my book, <a href="https://thinkingpacifism.net/world-war-ii/"><em>The Good War That Wasn’t—And Why It Matters: The Moral Legacy of World War II</em>.</a> Even though in our nation’s memory that war was mostly against the Nazis, it was the racism-fueled hatred toward the Japanese that drove the American war effort (soldiers were actually reluctant to fight against white Germans)—culminating, of course, with the celebration of nuclear devastation of two Japanese cities, inhabited by non-white people.</p>
<p>Only when I started studying the Civil War era did I think more seriously about the persistence of the “Virginia” vision of the US project—the definitive character of white supremacy at the core of the project. What Kendi calls “anti-Black racism” has been present throughout and across the board—and has not been displaced by various attempts at reform.</p>
<p>The key issue moving forward, I believe, is better to understand what it means to say that this racism is <em>systemic</em>. I think we may differentiate between two levels of racism—for now, let’s call them (1) direct, self-conscious, white supremacist, <em>“overt racism” </em>and (2) systemic, insidious, <em>“covert racism.” </em>Obviously, these two bleed into each other. It’s hard to know precisely where one stops and the other starts. But I think making this kind of distinction could be helpful.</p>
<p>I do tend to think that overt racism is probably more prevalent than many would like to admit. Our society has gotten pretty good at wishfully convincing itself that we are “color blind” (after all, we elected a black president), and it sustains that wishfulness by ignoring how overt racism can be disguised. There are all kinds of terms and images that don’t seem overtly racist on the surface but actually do signal a bigoted sensibility.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also think it is the case that many people in this society don’t want to be anti-Black racists (or racists in any way). Yet, clearly, the systems of our society are highly discriminatory—devastatingly so. Our current pandemic is making this painfully clear.</p>
<p>Some recent numbers cited by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/22/what-numbers-say-whites-blacks-live-two-different-americas/?arc404=true&amp;utm_campaign=wp_week_in_ideas&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_ideas">Sergio Peçanha in the <em>Washington Post</em> </a>illustrate this reality. Infant mortality for Black Americans is 2.5 times higher than that for White Americans, as is maternal mortality. “The percentage of black children living below the poverty line is three times that of whites.” The unemployment rate for Black Americans over the past 40 years has regularly been about twice that for White Americans. Probably the most dramatic statistic is that the average wealth per family is about <em>ten times higher</em> for White Americans ($171,000) than Black Americans ($17,150).</p>
<p>Right now we are becoming especially aware of the terrible toll our systemic racism is taking in relation to policing and criminal justice. There has been some progress in recent years in relation to incarceration rates, but still “incarceration rates for African Americans in general remain 5.6 times greater than for white Americans.” The rate of police killings for Black Americans is about 2.5 times higher than for White Americans. Peçanha doesn’t mention this in his article, but research has shown that the actual crime rate between blacks and whites in the US is about the same—even though the punishment rate of blacks is so much higher (see Michelle Alexander’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086CFB2NT/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0"><em>New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness</em></a>).</p>
<p>So, this covert racism is our big problem. And it’s difficult to know how to address it. It will take more than individuals deciding they want to be anti-racists—as important as that is. It will take understanding how systemic evil works. We are born into environments that shape us to be discriminatory, to be greedy, to be nationalistic. We need to understand the biases inherent in the American way of life. And we need to understand how those biases act on us in ways we don’t choose from very early in our lives.</p>
<p>I have found James Gilligan’s work on violence to be quite helpful (see his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Violence-Reflections-National-James-Gilligan/dp/0679779124/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14WLHK7HYQPMK&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=james+gilligan+violence&amp;qid=1593439628&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=james+gilligan%2Cstripbooks%2C140&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic</em></a>). He takes what he calls a “public health” approach that views violence as a disease rather than a moralistic approach that seeks to assess guilt and to punish offenders. I suspect this applies to how we might approach covert racism as well. It’s a disease. A public health approach would be to seek to identify the pathogen and to work at prevention and at healing for offenders along with survivors. And we may be better situated right now to do this work than ever before.</p>

  28 Jun 2020 - I would like to thank Richard Falk for his erudite and intelligent analysis of the workings of the ICC [Editorial TMS 22 Jun 2020]. Personally, I am not as surprised by the workings and politics of the ICC, because I usually give a different interpretation to ‘words’ used by politicians.

  24 Jun 2020 - The novel coronavirus is unusual, it was obvious early in the pandemic, as the pathogen seemed to spread much faster than other coronaviruses, and kill at a higher rate than influenza viruses.

  It is difficult to say when precisely the phenomenon commenced, but because it was first recorded at a Commencement Ceremony at a very small and unimportant “Liberal Arts” college in the embarrassing “fly-over” part of the country, and somewhat deftly reported by a sophomore reporter for the college newspaper, it was at first entitled “The Commencement Malefaction.”

  24 Jun 2020 - No civil society group in the United States has undergone as much censorious repression as the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement — better known simply as BDS — and the most radical critic of Israeli policy in Gaza and the West Bank. Twenty-eight states have passed “anti-boycott” legislation condemning BDS.

  22 Jun 2020 - Of course, there have been many Kaepernick moments that stretch back to the era of slavery, and forward to Rosa Parks’ 1956 refusal to go to the back of the bus sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott , King’s 1963 letter from the Birmingham Jail, and the death of George Floyd, some more resonant than others, but none have been enough to remove the dark stains of systemic racism from the fabric of daily life in America, and elsewhere in the world.

  The world has literally ‘lost it’ over the horrible word capitalism. This may seem like an overstatement, but it can be justified easily. Today the global economic system is awash in ‘capital’ worth trillions upon trillions of dollars, but it is not coming to our help. By what twisted economics can this situation be justified? The reality of the word capitalism is ugly but simple. It is GREED – or the worship of Mammon – in a newer disguise.

  29 Jun 2020 - When Lawrence Bell, an orphan living in an abandoned house in Camden, New Jersey, went to prison he was 14-years-old. Barely literate and weighing no more than 90 pounds, he had been pressured by three Camden police detectives into signing a confession for a murder and rape he insisted at his trial he did not commit. It made no difference. He would not be eligible to go before a parole board for 56 years. It was a de facto life sentence.

  I 2006 opprettet den australske redaktøren Julian Assange WikiLeaks for å publisere hemmeligstemplet materiale og lekkasje fra varslere. Den 18. desember 2018 trykket Klassekampen et utfyllende intervju med Julian Assanges far John Shipton om USAs utleveringskrav og den henlagte voldtektssaken i Sverige.  Assange risikerer 175 års fengsel i USA, og professor Jake Lynch forklarer hvorfor Assanges framtid er viktig for oss alle.

  22 juin 2020 - Pays le plus vulnérable du continent américain, Haïti est frappé par le covid-19 alors que la population est en prise avec les cyclones, une pauvreté généralisée, un gouvernement gangréné par la corruption et totalement décrédibilisé. Les derniers mots de Georges Floyd sont devenus sur les réseaux sociaux haïtiens un cri d’alerte : « Ayiti paka respire », Haïti ne peut pas respirer.

  Born in Prague, capital of what is now the Czech Republic, writer Franz Kafka grew up in an upper middle-class Jewish family. After studying law at the University of Prague, he worked in insurance and wrote in the evenings. In 1923, he moved to Berlin to focus on writing, but died of tuberculosis shortly after. His friend Max Brod published most of his work posthumously, such as Amerika and The Castle.

  July 1. That is the date by which Netanyahu has promised to complete the annexation of the West Bank. But what does that really mean? Most people think that means he will annex Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jericho, and the rest of the region. However, nothing can be farther from the truth.

  Saint Ex for the style was influenced by Frederic Nietzche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra which he had read. However, the spirit is much closer to Khalil Gibran's The Prophet. There is no indication that he had read  Gibran in Saint Ex's period in New York. It is more likely that both writers shared a common outlook on life.

  18 Jun 2020 - Activist and author Arundhati Roy discusses Indian society and the response that George Floyd’s killing has evoked, and the prevalence of racism and casteism in the country. About the pulling down of a statue of a slave trader in the US, she said such a move was impossible in present day India. “We are very far away from the day when statues like these will be removed or pulled down. We are at the stage when they are being installed and celebrated.”

  28 Jun 2020 – In a time of quarantine, isolation and anxiety, most literate isolates already have plowed through Decline &#038; Fall, War &#038; Peace, the complete set of Shakespeare’s dramas, and the Iliad. So, now the choice is between you and Paradise Lost – which is not everybody’s cup of tea. Widespread social disorder can be the expression of various conditions: civil war, sectarian strife, economic collapse, natural disasters, external incursions, etc. All of these situations are explicable by the application of some kind of causal logic.

  18 Juin 2020 - Un peu plus de six mois après le Coup d’Etat du 10/11 novembre 2019 en Bolivie contre le Président Evo Morales, actuellement réfugié en Argentine, ce dernier nous met en garde sur la situation désastreuse de son pays, soumis à un gouvernement de fait dirigé par la présidente autoproclamée Jeanine Anez qui non seulement réprime la population, provoquant des massacres, pourchassant et emprisonnant les dirigeants et militants politiques, mais détruit aussi de manière systématique le modèle social, économique et les avancées réalisées par le gouvernement renversé du MAS.

We must resist signing contracts with weapon makers profiting from endless immiseration of the Middle East and needless superpower rivalries inviting full nuclear war.

  Each religion implies, or comes right out and says, that it is the best or the only way to God. All others are inferior and should be ignored, dominated, pushed away, or even destroyed by force. In this way, a most difficult thing to break down is the barrier between us erected by our religions. A first-class religion is not the one that claims it is the highest religion.

  22 Jun 2020 - BlackRock is a global financial giant with customers in 100 countries and its tentacles in major asset classes all over the world; and it now manages the spigots to trillions of bailout dollars from the Federal Reserve. The fate of a large portion of the country’s corporations has been put in the hands of a megalithic private entity with the private capitalist mandate to make as much money as possible for its owners and investors; and that is what it has proceeded to do.

  Lumumba was a man of strong character who intended to pursue his policies regardless of the enemies he made within his country or abroad. Because of its wealth, size, and proximity to white-dominated southern Africa, Lumumba’s opponents feared the consequences of a radicalized Congo. Forced out of office during a political crisis, he was assassinated a short time later.

  Rebellion against established structures, the quest for personal values and a religious impulse are all elements in Siddhartha, published in 1922, perhaps his most widely-read book. It is not clear that Hesse found the harmony of enlightenment in his own life.  In his last major work The Glass Bead Game (1943) he describes what might be an ideal Buddhist monastery devoted to the discovery, preservation and dissemination of knowledge.

  23 Jun 2020 - Farmers can no longer bring their products to market to sell them. They must hand them over to a middleman who resells them to the system that processes, transports, packages and distributes them to the points of sale. Today it is the banks, multinationals and pension funds that dominate the food market and promote speculation through commodity derivatives. When there is an interruption in that chain, farmers are forced to burn or bury the products. A crime against humanity practiced in honor of the god of Capital.

  23 Jun 2020 - These comments follow on the disappointing failure of Prof Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur to respond to two respectful letters complaining about the arbitrary use of terms like “misinformation” and “disinformation” and  “anti-vaccinationist” as catch-all hate speech for anyone who criticises vaccine products, programs or the lobby.

  Space and Time are usually treated by scientists as an integral concept. But there is a basic difference of time from space. We can travel from one place to another. But time is different in the sense that we cannot go back; we can go into future but not into past.

  22 Jun 2020 - In the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere there are no hunger flags flying. The market stalls are stocked, customers are buying,  and prices are stable. Nicaraguan small farmers produce almost all the food the nation consumes, and have some leftover for export. We will examine how this is possible.

Here’s a selection of some happenings—fleeting or otherwise—in the Buddhist world this week.</p>
<h2><b>Upaya Zen Center Hosts Women Leaders Conference on Justice</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 21, Upaya Zen Center held an online conference of women leaders discussing the relationship between justice and faith. The conference, called “</span><a href="https://www.upaya.org/program/awakened-action-women-leaders-speak/?id=2326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awakened Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Women Leaders Speak to Race, Poverty, Climate, and the Pandemic,” featured speakers such as Jane Fonda, </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/dekila-chungyalpa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dekila Chungyalpa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/author/joannamacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna Macy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/with-eyes-in-all-directions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Solnit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more. In an Upaya </span><a href="https://www.upaya.org/2020/06/awakened-action-women-leaders-speak-to-race-poverty-climate-and-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the center’s founder and abbot, </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/author/joanhalifax/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roshi Joan Halifax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, expressed how remarkable and rare the opportunity was for women leaders and scientists to address the relationship between many types of injustice and ongoing historic challenges. “One of the powerful things about Upaya Zen Center being small, conscientious, and nimble is that we are able to respond quickly to historically important events of the times,” the post said.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tuva’s Head Lama Dies of COVID-19</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eighth Kamby Lama, Jampel Lodoy, died from complications of COVID-19 this week at age 45, </span><a href="https://www.buddhistdoor.net/news/kamby-lama-of-tuva-dies-from-health-complications-related-to-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhistdoor reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The most senior monk of Tuva, a small Russian republic bordering Mongolia, Jampel Lodoy was elected to his second term as Tuva’s supreme lama in November 2019. He contracted the coronavirus earlier this month and was placed in a medically induced coma; he had several medical conditions. Sholban Kara-ool, chairman of the Tuvan government, described his death as “a huge loss for our republic.” The late lama was known for building relationships with the neighboring Tibetan Buddhist republics of Kalmykia and Buryatia and constructing large monasteries. New coronavirus cases are decreasing in Russia, which has the third-highest number of cases and 8,594 deaths, according to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b><i>Tricycle</i></b><b> Contributing Editor </b><a href="https://tricycle.org/author/pico-iyer/"><b>Pico Iyer</b></a><b> Interviews The Dalai Lama</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acclaimed essayist and novelist Pico Iyer </span><a href="https://www.dalailama.com/videos/a-conversation-with-pico-iyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interviewed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Holiness the Dalai Lama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on June 17 as part of the Jaipur Literature Festival&#8217;s Brave New World series. The longtime friends spoke via video conference; the Dalai Lama, 84, has been in self-isolation since the coronavirus pandemic began. The Tibetan leader urged people to see themselves as members of one human community, and to develop </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">karuna</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [compassion] and practice </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ahimsa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [nonviolence] in response to the coronavirus pandemic and other crises, such as global warming. </span></p>

<h2><b>A New People Of Color Meditation Group</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tara Mandala-authorized teacher </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/author/karlajacksonbrewer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karla Jackson-Brewer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is leading a new donation-based </span><a href="https://www.taramandala.org/the-center/edi/#BBIPOC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meditation group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for anyone who identifies as black, brown, indigenous, or a person of color. The first virtual gathering was held on June 17; two more will be held on July 15 and August 19 via Zoom. No prior meditation experience is required, and individuals from all spiritual backgrounds are welcome to join.</span></p>
<h2><b>Japan Holds Anti-Racism Rally in Solidarity with Black Lives Matter</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 500 protestors in Tokyo took to the streets on Saturday to protest racial discrimination and police brutality, reported </span><a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/japan-holds-anti-racism-rally-protesting-homegrown-police-brutality-in-solidarity-with-black-lives-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Diplomat</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Protestors—all wearing face masks to protect against the spread of coronavirus—spoke out against racism within the Japanese police system and in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in American. At a smaller gathering, speakers paid tribute to black victims of US police violence, including George Floyd, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, while foreigners and mixed-race participants spoke about racism and discrimination in Japan. A similar protest against police violence took place on May 30, after a video circulated online showing Tokyo police holding down a Kurdish man, inflicting a serious neck injury before releasing him but was without charges.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ted Grimsrud—June 25, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Since we are in the midst of the turmoil, we don’t yet fully understand just how earthshaking this first half of 2020 will turn out to be. Right now, though, it feels as if we are in the midst of rapid and dramatic events that will change the world as we know it. It’s exciting but also unnerving. I wonder what thoughts those with pacifist convictions might have to offer.</p>
<p>What do I mean by “pacifist convictions”? I think of pacifism as an aspiration to live and think as if nothing matters as much as love. This leads on the one hand, to a commitment to resist domination and injustice, and on the other hand, to a commitment to avoid violence. I don’t think of pacifism as a quest for purity and total consistency so much as holding ahead of us the goals of healing, of justice, of compassion and recognizing, with Gandhi (perhaps our most important theorist of pacifism), that the means of achieving those goals must be consistent with the goals themselves.</p>
<p>This blog post will be the first of many as I try to return to more regular blog activity during our time of upheaval. I am being challenged to revisit my core convictions and try to imagine their relevance to the world I am observing. It’s a good time to try to think one’s thoughts through. Let me reflect on three pacifism-inspired questions: <em>(1) What about the impact of property destruction during the current demonstrations? (2) Is it possible for people seeking change to resist the polarization that seems so pervasive in American society right now? (3) Is it important to raise issues related to our nation’s warism even as we deal with more immediate crises?</em><span id="more-8723"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Property destruction</strong></p>
<p><em>(1) What about the impact of property destruction during the current demonstrations?</em> Pacifism that takes a Gandhian approach would see such property destruction as problematic. The point is not so much the intrinsic value of property. Certainly, inflicting harm on big box chain stores or police vehicles is not on the same moral level as doing violence against human beings. However, for a Gandhian such actions are not very effective.</p>
<p>Visible acts of property destruction seem to make it easier for defenders of the status quo to fan the fears of those in the general population whose interests may actually lie on the side of the demonstrators. Given the evidence from past uprisings, it seems likely that at least some of the damage has actually come due to <em>agent provocateurs </em>acting on behalf of the state. There are reasons why such actors are set loose. The people in power know that the general public tends to be pretty negative toward property destruction. This is why those trying to benefit politically by speaking against the demonstrations tend to exaggerate the destruction and use language of “rioting” and “out of control violence.” Is the reality that property destruction may be <em>useful</em> for the people in power an important reason to try to avoid it?</p>
<p>Certainly, the emotions of those who stand up in opposition to police violence, racism, and other injustices need to be respected. Their courage and commitment, their willingness to risk their own lives, and the insights of their critiques are to be celebrated. We don’t need sanctimonious moralizing by safe and comfortable people. Yet, we do need clear-eyed analyses of the dynamics of social change advocacy. Though we are in the midst of debates about how nonviolent the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s truly was, I still agree with those who point to the televised images of young people and other <em>peaceful</em> protesters remaining resolute in face of massive state violence in the South as being powerfully influential. And it does seem that over time the current protests have shown themselves to be more and more to be thoroughly nonviolent—and have been more and more influential.</p>
<p>I imagine that all people of good will in our society agree in at least a general way about how the realities of systemic racism and its horrendous impact in our country are being surfaced by COVID-19. This impact is exacerbated by police violence disproportionately aimed at people of color. The current demonstrations seem most likely to have a positive impact when they allow the truths of the current situation to be absorbed. It’s not like there needs to be a transformation in what people know so much as they simply would be <em>shown</em> the realities as clearly as possible. As that <em>showing</em> happens, the peaceful nature of the protests will make it more evident than ever that the vast majority of the violence comes from the state—and that that violence is what needs to be opposed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Resisting polarization</strong></p>
<p><em>(2) Is it possible for people seeking change to resist the polarization that seems so pervasive in American society right now?</em> To me, at the heart of pacifism is the desire to seek to overcome evil without adding to the evil. This means discerning and naming evil for what it is. Such discernment involves a clear sense of core convictions—especially, I’d say, convictions about the preciousness of life and the wrongness of attitudes and social structures that diminish and hurt people, especially people without much power or social status.</p>
<p>However, I believe that pacifism also involves resisting evil in a way that does not involve labeling and hurting perceived evildoers as themselves purely evil, as less than fully human, and as deserving of violence. The ability to name and resist the wrongness while not dehumanizing those responsible for the wrongness is difficult.</p>
<p>My sense is that we struggle with a tendency to operate within what I call a “moralistic” framework that responds to wrongness mainly with a focus on assessing blame and administering punishment. The dynamics of blame and punish tend to enhance the alienation and spiral of polarization, even violence.</p>
<p>We should hope for a balance that moves past the polarization while not acquiescing with the wrongness. This balance will retain a sense of the humanity of the people on the other side while still disagreeing and seeking to end the oppression. Such a balance would seem to require nonviolent tactics in order to combine respect with resistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Questioning warism</strong></p>
<p><em>(3) Is it important to raise issues related to our nation’s warism even as we deal with more immediate crises?</em> I believe that it will be impossible to move forward very far on the climate crisis, on the reshaping of our economy in face of the devastation being caused by the pandemic, or on the transformation of police violence without somehow loosening the hold of America’s military-industrial complex on virtually every aspect of our society.</p>
<p>It seems that practically, our society will be unable to devote the resources to find solutions to the problems of the climate crisis and the pandemic as long as we spend so much on preparing for wars, fighting wars, projecting our military power around the world with our uncounted bases, building and updating nuclear weapons, and all the other ways warism dominates public spending.</p>
<p>It also seems that the dynamics of warism have pervaded our police departments—weaponry, training, and simply the militaristic mentality. While I don’t necessarily want to claim that warism is inherently linked with white supremacy in the United States, it is profoundly striking to realize that since the end of World War II virtually all the wars of America have been (and still are) visited on people of color and that the extraordinary growth of mass incarceration has disproportionately had an impact on people of color.</p>
<p>Right now, it still seems like US warism mostly gets a free pass, and social justice energy gets focused on other issues. We should be aware that, so far, Joe Biden’s campaign for President positions itself to the <em>right</em> of Donald Trump on many foreign policy issues. It does not even seem to be on the table these days that we need drastically to cut military spending, drastically to reduce our nuclear arsenal, and drastically to change our philosophy of responding to various conflicts around the world from military-centered to diplomacy-centered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually believe that none of these three questions are pacifist-only questions. They should be questions for all people of good will. However, those with pacifist convictions might see them more clearly than most other people in a time of upheaval and uncertainty.</p>

<p><em>Tricycle is offering free access to <a href="https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/racial-justice/">select articles</a> during this uncertain time.</em></p>
</div>
<hr />
</div>
<p>On a recent still night as I watched global protests on TV against the killing of Black people, my heart caught a scene that profoundly crushed me. It occurred over a few seconds and my guess is that it <span style="font-weight: 400;">was not repeatedly publicized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The killing of innocent and defenseless Black people is not new, it’s more public. In my elder body, I have seen worse, and so have my ancestors. With the flash cards of our news cycles, memories are short, and <a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/dropping-distraction/">minds distracted</a>. Some of you may have forgotten how blatantly racist the majority senate was when President Obama was in office, and how this continues with even more force, fury, and fear. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of white folks in power never got over Obama and his family occupying the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to admit—and I know many of you are doing so loudly—that there is something about a White police officer lynching by knee a defenseless Black man who is using his last breath to call to his mama, that rips at the soul of Black people and reveals the soullessness of this nation. This public killing, so normalized, all on the hills of White vigilantes chasing down and killing an innocent and defenseless Black man </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">while jogging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Every time I see a white person jogging, I scream inside: Why can’t my people be carefree? There is so much Black harm, so many Black killings, and so much grief. I write to you on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juneteenth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a date marked for when <a href="https://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black people annually celebrate the ending of chattel slavery</a>, only to continue to witness modern-day expressions of violent and death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to this video clip of the protesters that cracked me wide open—a scene I could have easily missed had I chosen to brush my teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Black man, maybe 24—the age of my grandson—short, round body, dreadlocks, right hand gripping a baseball bat, walking with increasing intensity toward the window of a retail store. Then the most unexpected and amazing thing happened. Black protestors surrounded him, affirming him with hopeful chants, and encouraging him to join them in a peaceful protest. It took a few moments, but then he surrendered to their care. I sensed that perhaps his deeper wish had been met in that moment: to be seen, to have the weight of his rage shared, and to be cared for. Maybe he even glimpsed that while he could die that day, it would be with a softer heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day to day I had been coping reasonably well, maintaining a steady mindfulness practice and open protest, supporting coaching clients, community, and family back off their ledges. But in this moment—in this blink of an eye, this exhale, I was gutted in grief. What got me most was that I recognized myself in this young man—that part of me that feels insanely enraged, weary, and longing to call mama. I recognized the power of being seen in my suffering, and to surrendering to care—something I had denied needing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found myself sharing this experience with my <a href="https://ruthking.net/event/black-wisdom-circle-six-week-online-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Wisdom Circle</a> last week only to realize that they were the peaceful protestors surrounding me in compassionate presence, witnessing my trembling voice, grimacing face, tight fists, and raw rage; holding my grief and sadness until it dissolved; without interruption, just care. Within a few moments, I felt release, more spacious, and reposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I touched a deeper longing that many Black people share: to be seen by each other, reassured, and surrounded in loving care—this, to me, is the healing meaning of Juneteenth! This we can only give to ourselves.</span></p>

  <p>Beyond Prisons host Kim Wilson has a conversation with Dr. Erin Corbett, founder and CEO of <a href= "https://scea-inc.org/">Second Chance Educational Alliance, Inc</a>. It's  a community-based prison education program in CT. SCEA aims to provide formerly incarcerated men and women with the tools necessary to become fully engaged and contributing citizens.</p> <p>Erin has spent almost two decades in education access in a number of roles. With experience in independent school admission, enrichment programs, and postsecondary financial aid, her commitment to expanding postsecondary opportunities for all populations has served as the foundation of her professional endeavors.</p> <p>Kim and Erin talk about the benefits of post-secondary education for people in prison and the challenges associated with developing a prison education program. They also explore the issue of teaching without access to technology in a world where technology plays such a vital role in our lives, why higher ed in prison attracts people that fetishize prisoners and are invested in the notions of saviorism, and how the teaching authors like James Baldwin are transformative for some students.</p> <p>They conclude the conversation with Erin’s thoughts on what higher ed prison policy needs to focus on, including what questions to ask.</p> Episode Resources <p><a href= "https://bulletin.swarthmore.edu/fall-2017-issue-i-volume-cxv/unbarring-progress"> Feature in the Swarthmore College Alumni Magazine</a></p> <p><a href= "https://msisunplugged.com/2017/06/28/educating-the-incarcerated-learner-how-hbcus-can-help/"> Blog Post on MSI Unplugged</a></p> <p><a href= "https://medium.com/@Dr_ESC">Dr. Corbett on Medium</a> </p> <p>Dr. Corbett on Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/GrandmaCheesy77">@GrandmaCheesy77</a></p> <p>Second Chance Educational Alliance on Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/SCEA_Inc_CT">@SCEA_Inc_CT</a></p> Support Beyond Prisons <p class="">Support our show and <a href= "https://patreon.com/beyondprisons">join us on Patreon</a>.

  <p>June 23, 2020 2pm Pacific Time</p>
<p>We share RJI&#8217;s Global Advisory Council (GAC) meeting on June 19, 2020 recorded live via video conference. We bring the video meeting to you which includes 1 1/2 hours of this intense and important GAC meeting with our global experts. RJI is pleased to share this conference with you to provide an important global perspective on justice, justice reform and restorative justice. At this hour we are choosing to share our meetings with you with our global experts when normally they are internal.</p>
<p>The following countries were represented through our GAC: Paulo Moratelli (Brazil), Upneet Lalli (India), Pastor Jonathan Peter Clayton (South Africa), Pastor Jack Sullivan Jr. (Ohio, U.S.) and Lisa Rea, president of RJI and moderator. (See the full Global Advisory Council team on this site to learn more about our esteemed advisors and the work they do globally.)</p>
<p><strong>Subjects on the agenda</strong> <strong>today</strong> included racial violence, policing and restorative policing, RJI covid-19 reports in prisons &amp; jails and restorative justice work being done globally. RJI&#8217;s White Paper and webinar on restorative policing was discussed as well as our global recommendations on covid-19 in our justice systems. <em>(the white paper and covid-19 recommendations can be found on our website under News)</em></p>

  18 Jun 2020 - Israel is planning a move on July 1 that the international community regards as one of the gravest assaults on the international law: annexation of not only the decades-old settlements in the West Bank, which the U.N. Security Council in 2016 declared illegal to be permanent Israeli land, but also the Jordan Valley, that is central to Palestinian agriculture.

  We actually have a pretty good idea of what might have happened before the Big Bang. That is, as long as we define the Big Bang as the extremely hot, dense, rapidly expanding universe that is described by Einstein’s equations. That picture of the universe is very solid down to about a trillionth of a second after the supposed beginning of time. We can make good guesses down to about 10^-30th of a second. But before that?
